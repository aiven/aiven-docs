title: Send logs to AWS CloudWatch from Aiven web console
---

Send your Aiven service logs to the AWS CloudWatch using the [Aiven web console](https://console.aiven.io).

## Prerequisites

-   An AWS account, and which region it is in.
-   An Aiven account with a service running.
-   An AWS Access Key and Secret Key. Generate the credentials by
    visiting **IAM dashboard** then click **Users**, open the
    **Security credentials** tab, and choose **Create access key**.
    Click **Download** and keep them for a later instruction.

## Configure the integration

Start by configuring the link between the Aiven service and the AWS
CloudWatch. This setup only needs to be done once.

1.  Select **Integration endpoints** in the [Aiven
    Console](https://console.aiven.io/), then choose **AWS CloudWatch
    Logs**.
1.  Select **Add new endpoint** or **Create new**.
1.  Configure the settings for the new endpoint:
    -   **Endpoint name** is how you will refer to this logs integration
        when linking it to other Aiven services.
    -   Your AWS credentials: **Access Key** and **Secret Key**.
    -   Your AWS account **Region**.
    -   **Log Group Name** where your logs streams can be grouped in a
        group on AWS CloudWatch. If this field is not provided, it will
        be generated for you.
1.  Select **Create** to save this endpoint.

## Send logs from an Aiven service to AWS CloudWatch

1.  On the **Overview** page of your service, select **Integrations**
    and choose the **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** option.

1.  Pick the endpoint by the **Endpoint name** you created earlier from
    the dropdown and choose **Enable**.
1.  Visit your AWS account and look under **CloudWatch** and explore the
    **Logs** section to see the data flowing within a few minutes.

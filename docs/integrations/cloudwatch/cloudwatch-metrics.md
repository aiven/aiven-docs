## Configure the integration

Your first step is to create the endpoint to be used between the Aiven
service and the AWS CloudWatch. This setup only needs to be done once.

1. Click **Integration endpoints** in the web console, then choose
    **AWS CloudWatch Metrics** and **Add a new endpoint** or **Create
    new**.

1. Configure the settings for the new endpoint:
    -   **Endpoint name** is how you will refer to the AWS CloudWatch
        metrics integration when linking it to an Aiven service.
    -   **CloudWatch Namespace** where your metrics can be organized in
        different spaces.
    -   Your AWS credentials: **Access Key** and **Secret Key**.
    -   Your AWS account **Region**.
1. To save this endpoint, click **Create**.

## Send metrics from an Aiven service to AWS CloudWatch

For each of the services whose metrics should be sent to your AWS CloudWatch:
<!-- vale off -->
1. From the **Overview** page of your service, click **Integrations**
   and choose the **Amazon CloudWatch Metrics** option.

1. Choose the endpoint by the **Endpoint name** you created earlier
   and choose **Continue**.

1. Customize which metrics to send to the CloudWatch. To do
   this, toggle a metric group or individual metric field.

1. Go to your AWS account and check the **CloudWatch** service. You can
   go to the **Metrics** section to see your Aiven service metrics
   data. It may take a few minutes until the data arrives.

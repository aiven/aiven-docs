[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a monitoring platform, allowing
you to keep an eye on all aspects of your cloud estate. Aiven has
integrations that make it easy to include an Aiven service in your
Datadog dashboards.

## Datadog for metrics

You can send the metrics from any or all of your Aiven services to
Datadog. The integration also supports adding tags to the data, either
for all metrics, or on a per-service basis.

If you're using Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ® you can also

service logs to Datadog. We have a handy guide to show you

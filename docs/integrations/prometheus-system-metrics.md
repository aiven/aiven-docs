title: Prometheus system metrics
---

Learn how to check what metrics are available for monitoring your
service using Prometheus, and find out which of the available metrics
are particularly worth monitoring and why.

## About the Prometheus integration

The Prometheus integration allows you to monitor your Aiven services and
understand the resource usage. Using this integration, you can also
track some non-service-specific metrics that may be worth monitoring.

To start using Prometheus for monitoring the metrics, you need to
[configure the Prometheus integration and set up the Prometheus server](/docs/platform/howto/integrations/prometheus-metrics).

## Get a list of available service metrics

To discover the metrics available for your services, make an HTTP `GET`
request to your Prometheus service endpoint.

1.  Once your Prometheus integration is configured, collect the
    following Prometheus service details from [Aiven
    Console](https://console.aiven.io/) \> the **Overview** page of your
    service \> the **Connection information** section \> the
    **Prometheus** tab:

    -   Prometheus URL
    -   Username
    -   Password

2.  Make a request to get a snapshot of your metrics, replacing the
    placeholders in the following code with the values for your service:

    ```bash
    curl -k --user USERNAME:PASSWORD PROMETHEUS_URL/metrics
    ```

The resulting output is a full list of the metrics available for your
service.

## Metrics

### CPU usage

CPU usage metrics are helpful in determining if the CPU is constantly
being maxed out. For a high-level view of the CPU usage for a single CPU
service, you can use the following:

```bash
100 - cpu_usage_idle{cpu="cpu-total"}
```

:::note
A process with a `nice` value larger than `0` is categorized as
`cpu_usage_nice`, which is not included in `cpu_usage_user`.
:::

:::tip
It can be useful to monitor `cpu_usage_iowait{cpu="cpu-total"}`. Its
high value indicates that the service node is working on something I/O
intensive. For example, if `cpu_usage_iowait{cpu="cpu-total"}` equals
`40`, the CPU is idle waiting for disk or network I/O operations for 40%
of time.
:::

Some important CPU-related metrics you can collect and monitor are
generated from the [Telegraf
plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/cpu).
They are as follows:

| Metrics                | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cpu_usage_idle`       | Percentage of time the CPU is idle                                                      |
| `cpu_usage_system`     | Percentage of time the Kernel code is consuming the CPU                                 |
| `cpu_usage_user`       | Percentage of time the CPU is in the user-space program with a `nice` value \<= `0`     |
| `cpu_usage_nice`       | Percentage of time the CPU is in the user-space program with a `nice` value \> `0`      |
| `cpu_usage_iowait`     | Percentage of time that the CPU is idle when the system has pending disk I/O operations |
| `cpu_usage_steal`      | Percentage of time waiting for the hypervisor to give CPU cycles to the VM              |
| `cpu_usage_irq`        | Percentage of time the system is handling interrupts                                    |
| `cpu_usage_softirq`    | Percentage of time the system is handling software interrupts                           |
| `cpu_usage_guest`      | Percentage of time the CPU is running for a guest OS                                    |
| `cpu_usage_guest_nice` | Percentage of time the CPU is running for a guest OS with a low priority                |

### Disk usage

Monitoring the disk usage ensures that applications or processes don\'t
fail due to an insufficient disk storage.

:::tip
Consider monitoring `disk_used_percent` and `disk_free`.
:::

The following table lists some important disk usage metrics you can
collect and monitor:

| Metrics             | Description                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disk_free`         | Free space on the service disk                                                                                        |
| `disk_used`         | Used space on the disk, for example, `8.0e+9` (8,000,000,000 bytes)                                                   |
| `disk_total`        | Total space on the disk (free and used)                                                                               |
| `disk_used_percent` | Percentage of the disk space used equal to `disk_used / disk_total * 100`, for example, `80` (80% service disk usage) |
| `disk_inodes_free`  | Number of index nodes available on the service disk                                                                   |
| `disk_inodes_used`  | Number of index nodes used on the service disk                                                                        |
| `disk_inodes_total` | Total number of index nodes on the service disk                                                                       |

### Memory usage

Metrics for monitoring the memory consumption are essential to ensure
the performance of your service.

:::tip
Consider monitoring `mem_available` (in bytes) or
`mem_available_percent`, as this is the estimated amount of memory
available for application without swapping.
:::

### Network usage

Monitoring the network provides visibility of your network and an
understanding of the network utilization and traffic, allowing you to
act immediately in case of network issues.

:::tip
It may be worth monitoring the number of established TCP sessions
available in the `netstat_tcp_established` metric.

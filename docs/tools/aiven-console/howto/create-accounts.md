title: Create organizations and organizational units
---

Organizations and organizational units can be used to group projects and
apply common settings like authentication and access for groups of
users. For details and recommendations on creating hierarchical
organizations in Aiven, see the article on
[organizations, units, and projects](/docs/platform/concepts/projects_accounts_access). When you sign up for Aiven, an organization is
automatically created for you.

## Create an organizational unit

You can create an organizational unit within an organization to group
your projects by, for example, your departments or environments. To
create an organizational unit in the [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io):

1.  In the organization where you want to create an organizational unit,
    click **Admin**.
2.  In the **Organizational units** section, click **Create
    organizational unit**.
3.  Enter a name for the unit.
4.  Optional: Select any projects to assign to this
    organizational unit. You can search for projects by name.
5.  Click **Create organizational unit**.

Your organizational unit is shown in the list. Click the unit name to
view and manage its projects.

:::note
Only one level of nesting is supported. This means that organizational
units cannot be created within other units.

## Create an organization

:::important
We recommend using only one organization and using organizational units
to group your projects.

Creating a new organization requires you to manually configure
organization-level settings again such as
[billing groups, authentication settings, and groups](/docs/platform/concepts/projects_accounts_access).

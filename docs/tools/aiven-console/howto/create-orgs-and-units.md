Organizations and organizational units help you group projects and apply common settings like authentication and access.

When you sign up for Aiven, an organization is automatically created for you.
You can add organizational units in your organization to group related projects
and create custom
[hierarchical organizations](/docs/platform/concepts/orgs-units-projects).

## Create an organizational unit

You can create an organizational unit within an organization to group
your projects by, for example, your departments or environments. Only one level of
nesting is supported. This means that you can't create organizational units
within other units.

<Tabs groupId="group1">

1.  In the organization, click **Admin**.
1.  In the **Organizational units** section, click **Create organizational unit**.
1.  Enter a name for the unit.
1.  Click **Create organizational unit**.

## Create an organization

:::important
You can only verify a domain in one organization, meaning you can't set up SAML
authentication, user provisioning with SCIM, or managed users for the same domain
in another organization. Additionally, support and commitment contracts cannot
be shared across organizations.

When you create another organization you also have to manually configure all settings
for the new organization such as:
- billing groups
- authentication policies
- users and groups
- roles and permissions

    **Organizations**.
1.  Click **Create organization**.
1.  Enter a name for the organization.
1.  Optional: Select any projects to assign to this
    organization. You can search for projects by name.
1.  Click **Create organization**.

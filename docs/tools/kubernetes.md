title: Aiven Operator for Kubernetes®
---

Aiven Operator for Kubernetes® allows users to manage Aiven services
through the Kubernetes® API by using [Custom Resource Definitions
(CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/).

:::note
Only Aiven for PostgreSQL®, Aiven for Apache Kafka®, Aiven for
ClickHouse®, Aiven for Redis®\*, and Aiven for OpenSearch® are supported
at this time.

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Kubernetes Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use
of custom resources to manage applications and their components.

:::

## Getting started

Take your first steps by configuring the Aiven Operator and deploying a
PostgreSQL® database.

### Requirements

Access to a Kubernetes cluster where you can run the operator. To try it
out locally, we recommend using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). You
can install it by following their [official
documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation).

We will be installing the operator with [Helm](https://helm.sh/). Follow
their [official instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to
install it if you don't have it already.

You\'ll also need an Aiven account. If you don't have one yet, [sign up
for
Aiven](https://console.aiven.io/signup?utm_source=devportal&utm_campaign=k8s-operator&utm_content=post)
(and enjoy a free trial for new accounts). Once you have your account
set, please generate and note down the
[authentication token](/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token) and your project name, they will be used to authenticate the
Kubernetes operator with Aiven's API.

### Install the operator

Once you have a Kubernetes cluster and an Aiven authentication token, we
can proceed to install the operator.

Install the `cert-manager` with the command below. It is used to manage
the webhook TLS certificates used by our operator.

:::tip
You can use the operator without `cert-manager` and the admission
webhooks, skip this step and move on to the Helm chart section.
:::

:::note
[For GKE version >=1.21 VPC users, firewall rule to explicitly allow
ingress to port
9443](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#add_firewall_rules)
needs to be added for admission webhook.
:::

:::tip
If you are running a GKE \"Autopilot\" cluster in Google Cloud Platform,
you will need to be using GKE version >=1.21 and install `cert-manager`
into the `cert-manager` namespace, as per [this GitHub issue
comment](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/3717#issuecomment-975031637)
:::

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
```

Verify the `cert-manager` installation by checking if their pods are up
and running:

```bash
kubectl get pod -n cert-manager
```

When you see pods in the list with their status showing \"Running\",
then you are ready to proceed.

Add the [Aiven Helm chart
repository](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-charts/) and update your
local Helm information:

```bash
helm repo add aiven https://aiven.github.io/aiven-charts
helm repo update
```

Now let's install the CRD and then the operator itself:

```bash
helm install aiven-operator-crds aiven/aiven-operator-crds
helm install aiven-operator aiven/aiven-operator
```

:::tip
You can use
`helm install aiven-operator aiven/aiven-operator --set webhooks.enabled=false`
to disable the admission webhooks.
:::

Verify the installation by making sure the operator pod is running with
the `get pod` command:

```bash
kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=aiven-operator
```

If your pod is listed with status \"Running\" then all is well.

### Authenticating

Before creating a service, we need to authenticate the operator with
Aiven's API. To do so, create the Kubernetes secret with the command
below, substituting the `<your-token-here>` with the authentication
token generated in the \"Requirements\" section above. This needs to be
created in the namespace which is going to be used to create your Aiven
services.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic aiven-token --from-literal=token="<your-token-here>"
```

### Deploying Aiven for PostgreSQL

It's showtime! Let's create an Aiven for PostgreSQL service using the
Custom Resource provided by the operator. Create a file named
`pg-sample.yaml` with the content below, substituting the
`<your-project-name>` with your Aiven project name. Take a look at the
commented lines to understand better what each field represents.

```yaml
apiVersion: aiven.io/v1alpha1
kind: PostgreSQL
metadata:
  name: pg-sample
spec:

  # gets the authentication token from the `aiven-token` secret
  authSecretRef:
    name: aiven-token
    key: token

  # outputs the PostgreSQL connection on the `pg-connection` secret
  connInfoSecretTarget:
    name: pg-connection

  # add your Project name here
  project: <your-project-name>

  # cloud provider and plan of your choice
  # you can check all of the possibilities here https://aiven.io/pricing
  cloudName: google-europe-west1
  plan: startup-4

  # general Aiven configuration
  maintenanceWindowDow: friday
  maintenanceWindowTime: 23:00:00

  # specific PostgreSQL configuration
  userConfig:
    pg_version: '11'
```

Apply the resource with the command below:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pg-sample.yaml
```

You can verify the status of your service with the following command.

```bash
kubectl get postgresqls.aiven.io pg-sample
```

Check the output of the command for your service; once the `STATE` field
has the value `RUNNING`, it is ready to use.

### Using the service

Once the service is up and running (you can see your database in the
Aiven web console as well at this point) let's deploy a pod to test the
connection to PostgreSQL from Kubernetes.

Create a file named `pod-psql.yaml` with the content below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: psql-test-connection
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
    - image: postgres:11-alpine
      name: postgres
      command: ['psql', '$(DATABASE_URI)', '-c', 'SELECT version();']

      # the pg-connection secret becomes environment variables
      envFrom:
      - secretRef:
          name: pg-connection
```

The connection information in this case, the PostgreSQL service URI, is
automatically created by the operator within a Kubernetes secret named
after the value from the `connInfoSecretTarget.name` field.

Go ahead and run `apply` to create the pod and test the connection:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-psql.yaml
```

It will run, output the PostgreSQL version and terminate. We can see the
logs with the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs psql-test-connection
```

Well done, you have an Aiven for PostgreSQL service deployed through
Kubernetes.

### Clean up

To destroy the resources created, execute the following commands:

```bash
kubectl delete pod psql-test-connection
kubectl delete postgresqls.aiven.io pg-sample
```

To remove the operator and `cert-manager` (if installed), use the
following:

```bash
helm uninstall aiven-operator
helm uninstall aiven-operator-crds
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
```

title: Aiven CLI
---

The Aiven command line interface (CLI) lets you use the Aiven platform and services in a scriptable way through the API.

## Get started

### Install

The `avn` utility is a Python package that you can install using `pip`:

```
pip install aiven-client
```

You can also use [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/aiven-client) to install it:

```
brew install aiven-client
```

To check your installation run `avn --version`.

### Authenticate

There are two options for authenticating. The first is to use your
email and password:

1. To log in with your email, run:
   ```
   avn user login EMAIL_ADDRESS
   ```

1. When prompted, enter your password.

For increased security, you can use an
[authentication token](/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token) by running
this command:

```
avn user login EMAIL_ADDRESS --token
```

## Commands

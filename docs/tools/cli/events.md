The `avn events` command is an audit log of things that have happened in
a particular project, including:

-   timestamp of when the event occurred
-   which user performed the action (email address of the user, or
    \"Aiven Automation\" where it was an automatic change)
-   the type of event, such as `service_create`, `project_vpc_create` or
    `service_master_promotion` (this is not an exhaustive list and new
    event types are added from time to time
-   the name of the service affected
-   a more detailed description of the event

An example of events output (note that the newest event is shown first):

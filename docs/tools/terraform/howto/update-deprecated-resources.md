title: Update deprecated resources
---

Migrate from resources that have been deprecated or renamed without destroying existing resources.

:::tip
Backup your Terraform state file `terraform.tfstate` to use in the case
of a rollback.
:::

In the following example, the `aiven_database` field is migrated to the
new `aiven_pg_database` field for an Aiven for PostgreSQLÂ® service.

1.  Replace references to the deprecated field with the new field. In
    the following file `aiven_database` was replaced with
    `aiven_pg_database`:

    ```
    - resource "aiven_database" "mydatabase" {
        project       = aiven_project.myproject.project
        service_name  = aiven_pg.mypg.service_name
        database_name = "<DATABASE_NAME>"
    }


    + resource "aiven_pg_database" "mydatabase" {
        project       = aiven_project.myproject.project
        service_name  = aiven_pg.mypg.service_name
        database_name = "<DATABASE_NAME>"
    }
    ```

2.  List of all resources in the state file:

    ```
    terraform state list
    ```

3.  Remove the resource from the control of Terraform:

    ```
    terraform state rm <DEPRECATED_RESOURCE>
    ```

    :::tip
    Use the `-dry-run` flag to preview the changes without applying
    them.
    :::

4.  Add the resource back to Terraform by importing it as a new
    resource:

    ```
    terraform import <NEW_RESOURCE> project_name/service_name/db_name
    ```

5.  Check that the import is going to run as you expect:

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

6.  Apply the new configuration:

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

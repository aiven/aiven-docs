title: Enable debug logging for Terraform
---

If you are encountering issues when deploying your Aiven service via
Terraform, enabling debugging for Terraform can help you to get more
information about the problem. This information is also helpful if you
need to contact our support team for help.

1.  Set the environment variable `TF_LOG` to define the level of logging
    that should be enabled.

    Enable debugging on Linux:

    ```Shell
    export TF_LOG="DEBUG"
    ```

    Enable debugging for PowerShell:

    ```Powershell
    $env:TF_LOG="DEBUG"
    ```

    The standard logging levels are available: `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`,
    `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`, `ALL`, and `OFF`.

2.  Configure your debug log output to any directory with any file name
    (i.e. `terraform-debug.log`) by setting the environment variable
    `TF_LOG_PATH`.

    In the example below, we are sending output logs to the temporary
    folder with the name terraform-debug.log.

    Configure log location on Linux:

    ```Shell
    export TF_LOG_PATH=‚Äù/tmp/terraform-debug.log
    ```

    Configure log location for PowerShell:

    ```Powershell
    $env:TF_LOG_PATH="C:\tmp\terraform-debug.log"
    ```

    This additional output helps you to trace where the error occurred
    in more detail when applying your terraform resources.

3.  To generate an example of the core and provider logs,run:

    ```Shell
    terraform refresh
    ```

title: Set up Google Cloud Platform virtual network peering with Terraform
---

This help article provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a
VPC peering connection between Aiven and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
using Terraform. See the [Using VPC
peering](/docs/platform/howto/manage-vpc-peering)
article for how to set up a Project VPC.

Before you start, make sure you have an Aiven authentication token and
have set up the Google Cloud SDK.

## Prerequisites:

-   Create an
    [Aiven authentication token](/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token).
-   [Install the Google Cloud
    SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
-   Authenticate using the following command

```console
gcloud auth application-default login
```

## Set up the Terraform variables:

Create a file named `variables.tf` and add the following code:

```
variable "aiven_api_token" {}
variable "gcp_project_id" {}
```

This file declares the variables for the Aiven API token and the Google
Cloud project ID.

## Configure the Terraform providers:

Create a file named `provider.tf` and add the following code:

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
    aiven = {
      source  = "aiven/aiven"
      version = ">=4.0.0, <5.0.0"
    }
  }
}
provider "aiven" {
  api_token = var.aiven_api_token
}
provider "google" {
  project = var.gcp_project_id
  region  = "us-central1"
  zone    = "us-central1-a"
}
```

This code initializes the Aiven and Google providers, specifying the
required provider versions and configurations. It also uses the
variables defined in the `variables.tf` file

## Create a VPC and subnet in GCP:

Create a file named project.tf and add the following code:

```
#Get Aiven project details
data "aiven_project" "my_project" {
  project = "project_name"
}
#Create a VPC in GCP
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc" {
  name                    = "my-vpc"
  auto_create_subnetworks = "false"
}
#Create a subnet in the GCP VPC
resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "subnet" {
  name          = "my-subnet"
  region        = "us-central1"
  ip_cidr_range = "10.0.0.0/24"
  network       = google_compute_network.vpc.self_link
}
```

This code retrieves the details of your Aiven project, creates a VPC in
GCP, and creates a subnet within that VPC.

## Create a VPC in Aiven:

Add the following code to your `project.tf` file to create a VPC in
Aiven:

```
resource "aiven_project_vpc" "my_vpc" {
  project      = data.aiven_project.my_project.project
  cloud_name   = "google-us-central1"
  network_cidr = "192.168.0.0/24"
}
```

This code creates a VPC in your Aiven project. The `network_cidr`
parameter specifies the CIDR range for the Aiven VPC. Ensure that this
CIDR range does not overlap with the CIDR range of your GCP VPC. In this
example, the Aiven VPC uses the CIDR range \"192.168.0.0/24\"

## Create a peering connection between Aiven and GCP:

Add the following code to your project.tf file to create a peering
connection between the Aiven VPC and your GCP VPC:

```
resource "aiven_gcp_vpc_peering_connection" "my_peering" {
  vpc_id             = aiven_project_vpc.my_vpc.id
  gcp_project_id     = var.gcp_project_id
  peer_vpc           = google_compute_network.vpc.name
  }
resource "google_compute_network_peering" "aiven_peering" {
  depends_on         = [aiven_gcp_vpc_peering_connection.my_peering]
  name               = var.gcp_project_id
  network            = google_compute_network.vpc.self_link
  peer_network       = aiven_gcp_vpc_peering_connection.my_peering.self_link
  }
```

This code creates a peering connection between the Aiven VPC and the GCP
VPC by using the `aiven_gcp_vpc_peering_connection` and
`google_compute_network_peering` resources. The depends_on attribute
ensures that the `aiven_gcp_vpc_peering_connection` resource is created
before the `google_compute_network_peering` resource.

## Apply the Terraform configuration and verify the VPC peering status:

Run the following commands to initialize and apply the Terraform
configuration:

```console
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Review the proposed changes and enter yes when prompted to proceed.
Terraform will create the VPC peering connection between Aiven and GCP.
After the resources have been created, verify that the VPC peering
connection is active by checking the state attribute of the
`google_compute_network_peering` resource. It should have changed from
\"PENDING_PEER\" to \"ACTIVE\"

```console
terraform show
```

Look for the `google_compute_network_peering.aiven_peering` resource in
the output, and confirm that the state attribute is set to \"ACTIVE\".
This indicates that the VPC peering connection between Aiven and GCP has
been successfully established.

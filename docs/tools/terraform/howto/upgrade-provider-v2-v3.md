title: Upgrade Aiven Provider for Terraform from v2 to v3
---

This article will walk you through upgrading the Aiven Terraform
Provider from v2 to v3.

## Major changes in v3

Aiven Terraform Provider has a [detailed
changelog](https://github.com/aiven/terraform-provider-aiven/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
but the main additions in v3 are:

-   Generic `aiven_vpc_peering_connection` replaced with provider
    specific resources
-   Generic `aiven_service_user` replaced with service specific
    resources
-   Generic `aiven_database` replaced with service specific resources

## Upgrade Aiven Terraform provider

Update the Aiven Terraform Provider by editing the providers block of
your script to include the latest version of the Aiven Terraform
Provider (v3.8.1 at the time of writing):

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aiven = {
      source  = "aiven/aiven"
      version = ">=3.0.0, < 4.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip
You might need to run `terraform init -upgrade` for the provider version
upgrade to take place.

## Update to provider specific VPC peering connection resource syntax

V3 of the Aiven Terraform Provider moves away from using
`aiven_vpc_peering_connection` as a resource, and instead provides
provider specific resources such as
`aiven_azure_vpc_peering_connection`. Since we probably don't want to
destroy existing resources and make new ones, this guide will help you
perform the migration safely.

:::warning
Since `aiven_vpc_peering_connection` and the new one such as
`aiven_azure_vpc_peering_connection` are different kinds of resources,
simply rewriting the code would cause destructive actions. These steps
will preserve your resources.
:::

Please also note that running `terraform state mv <a> <b>` is not
recommended because these are different resource types.

:::tip
Backup your Terraform state file `terraform.tfstate` (if available),
just in case of potential rollback.
:::

To safely make this change you will:

-   Change the code
-   Remove old resource from the state
-   Import already existing resource to the Terraform state.

1.  To change from the old `aiven_vpc_peering_connection` to the new
    `aiven_azure_vpc_peering_connection` resource, the resource type
    should be changed. Any references to
    `aiven_vpc_peering_connection.foo.*` should be updated to instead
    read `aiven_azure_vpc_peering_connection.foo.*` instead.

    Here's an example showing the update in action:

    ```
    - resource "aiven_vpc_peering_connection" "foo" {
        vpc_id                = data.aiven_project_vpc.vpc.id
    -   peer_cloud_account    = "Azure subscription ID"
    -   peer_vpc              = "Azure virtual network name of the peered VPC"
        peer_azure_app_id     = "Azure app registration id in UUID4 form"
        peer_azure_tenant_id  = "Azure tenant id in UUID4 form"
        peer_resource_group   = "Azure resource group name of the peered VPC"
      }

    + resource "aiven_azure_vpc_peering_connection" "foo" {
        vpc_id                = data.aiven_project_vpc.vpc.id
    +   azure_subscription_id = "Azure subscription ID"
    +   vnet_name             = "Azure virtual network name of the peered VPC"
        peer_azure_app_id     = "Azure app registration id in UUID4 form"
        peer_azure_tenant_id  = "Azure tenant id in UUID4 form"
        peer_resource_group   = "Azure resource group name of the peered VPC"
      }
    ```

2.  Check the current state of the world:

    ```
    terraform state list | grep azure
    ```

3.  Remove the resource from the control of Terraform:

    ```
    terraform state rm aiven_vpc_peering_connection.foo
    ```

    :::tip
    Use the `-dry-run` flag to see this change before it is actually
    made
    :::

4.  Add the resource back to Terraform by importing it as a new resource
    with the new type:

    ```
    terraform import aiven_azure_vpc_peering_connection.foo project_name/vpc_id/azure_subscription_id/vnet_name
    ```

5.  Check that the import is going to run as you expect:

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

6.  Apply the new configuration:

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    :::note
    You can follow a similar approach to update `aiven_database` and
    `aiven_service_user` resources, which have been deprecated in v3 of
    the provider.

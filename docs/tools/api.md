title: Aiven API
---

Use the Aiven API to programmatically perform any task that you can do
through the web interface. This is an ideal way to automate tasks
involving Aiven at every stage of your workflow.

Common use cases for the Aiven API:

-   Use with CI (Continuous Integration) to spin up data platforms on
    Aiven for use during test runs.
-   Integrate with other parts of your existing automation setup to
    achieve complex tasks.
-   Deploy and tear down development or demo platforms on a schedule.

We make the API available to all Aiven users. It is also the engine
behind the Aiven Console, so you should find that all operations are
also available through the API.

## API quickstart

-   **Postman**: Try [Aiven on
    Postman](https://www.postman.com/aiven-apis/workspace/aiven/documentation/21112408-1f6306ef-982e-49f8-bdae-4d9fdadbd6cd)
    and start working with your data platform programmatically.
-   **API documentation**: Check the [API documentation and OpenAPI
    description](https://api.aiven.io/doc/) to work with the API
    directly.

## Authentication

Most (but not all) endpoints require authentication. You\'ll need an
authentication token from the [profile section of your Aiven
console](https://console.aiven.io/profile/auth).

Send this token in the header, using a structure like this, and
replacing `TOKEN` with your actual API token:

```
Authorization: aivenv1 TOKEN
```

Read more about
[authentication tokens](/docs/platform/concepts/authentication-tokens).

## Handling JSON responses

The [Aiven API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/) returns information in JSON
format, sometimes a lot of information. This is perfect for machines but
not ideal for humans. Try a tool like `jq`
([https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)) to make things easier to read and
manipulate.

## API examples

In the following examples, replace `{TOKEN}` with your own value of the
authentication token.

### List your projects

```
curl -H "Authorization: aivenv1 {TOKEN}" https://api.aiven.io/v1/project
```

The following is a sample response:

```json
{
  "project_membership": {
    "my-best-demo": "admin",
    "aiven-sandbox": "admin"
  },
  "project_memberships": {
    "my-best-demo": [
      "admin"
    ],
    "aiven-sandbox": [
      "admin"
    ]
  },
  "projects": [
    {

    }
  ]
}
```

## List of cloud regions

This endpoint does not require authorization; if you aren't
authenticated then the standard set of clouds will be returned.

```
curl https://api.aiven.io/v1/clouds
```

The following is a sample response:

```json
{
  "clouds": [
    {
      "cloud_description": "Africa, South Africa - Amazon Web Services: Cape Town",
      "cloud_name": "aws-af-south-1",
      "geo_latitude": -33.92,
      "geo_longitude": 18.42,
      "geo_region": "africa"
    },
    {
      "cloud_description": "Africa, South Africa - Azure: South Africa North",
      "cloud_name": "azure-south-africa-north",
      "geo_latitude": -26.198,
      "geo_longitude": 28.03,
      "geo_region": "africa"
    },
```

For most endpoints where a cloud is used as an input, the `cloud_name`
from this result is the field to use.

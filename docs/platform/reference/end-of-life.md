## Aiven for M3DB

**Timeline**: End of life (EOL) on April 30, 2025

### What happens after EOL

Service status and data access: After April 30, 2025, all running Aiven for M3DB
services are powered off and deleted, making data from these services inaccessible.

### Recommended alternative

Aiven for Metrics provides a seamless replacement for time-series workloads.

- **Aiven for Metrics**: Provides a seamless transition for time-series workloads,
  supporting PromQL for query compatibility. Refer to the
  [migration guide for Aiven for M3DB to Aiven for Metrics](https://aiven.io/docs/products/metrics/howto/migrate-m3db-thanos)
  for instructions.
- **Dashboard migration:** If you use Aivenâ€™s pre-made Metrics and Grafana dashboard
  integration, your dashboards migrate automatically. Custom dashboards need to be
  manually reconfigured.

To ensure uninterrupted service, complete your migration to Aiven for Metrics before
April 30, 2025. For further assistance, contact
[Aiven support team](mailto:support@aiven.io) or your [sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io).

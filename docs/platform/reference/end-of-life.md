## Aiven for M3DB

**EOL date**: April 30, 2025

### Service impact

After April 30, 2025, all running Aiven for M3DB
services are powered off and deleted, making data from these services inaccessible.

### Migration options

  supporting PromQL for query compatibility. See the
  [migration guide for Aiven for M3DB to Aiven for Metrics](https://aiven.io/docs/products/metrics/howto/migrate-m3db-thanos)
  for instructions.
- **Dashboard migration:** If you use Aivenâ€™s pre-configured Metrics and Grafana dashboard
  integration, your dashboards migrate automatically. Custom dashboards need to be
  manually reconfigured.

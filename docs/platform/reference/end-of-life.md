Valkey is fully compatible with Aiven for Caching, allowing your existing applications
and workflows to operate without modification. Essential settings, including DNS, URLs,
ACLs, and user configurations, remain unchanged, ensuring minimal impact on your
infrastructure and workflows.

For upgrade instructions, see

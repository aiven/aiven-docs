title: End of life for major versions of Aiven services and tools
---

End of life (EOL) is the date after which Aiven services and tools are no longer supported or maintained.

## Aiven services

Aiven aims to follow the EOL schedule set by the original authors and
maintainers of the open source software (the upstream projects). Once
the upstream project retires a specific version, they do not receive
security updates and critical bug fixes anymore by the maintainers.

Outdated services don't offer the level of protection our customers
need, so Aiven follows the upstream project's EOL schedule to ensure
that Aiven services are always running on supported versions.

### Version numbering

Aiven services inherit the upstream project's software versioning
scheme. Depending on the service, a major version can be either a single
digit (for example, PostgreSQL® 14) or in the format `major.minor` (for
example, Kafka® 3.2). The exact version of the service is visible in the
[Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) when the service is running.

### Aiven for Elasticsearch®

Aiven for Elasticsearch major versions will reach EOL on the same date
as the upstream open source project's EOL. [Aiven for
OpenSearch®](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/products/opensearch.html) is
Aiven's service offering for Elasticsearch.

| Version | Aiven EOL  | Upstream EOL       |

### Aiven for OpenSearch®

Aiven for OpenSearch® is the open source continuation of the original
Elasticsearch service. The EOL for Aiven for OpenSearch® is generally
dependent on the upstream project.

### Aiven for M3DB

Starting from v1.5, Aiven for M3DB versions will reach EOL six months
after newer major and minor versions are made available on the Aiven
platform.

### EOL policy for major versions

The Aiven EOL policy is applicable only for services whose major
versions are controlled until the customer.

It applies to both powered-on and powered-off services running the
affected versions.

### EOL notifications

When Aiven sets the EOL date for a service major version:

-   Customers receive an email notification along with instructions on
    the next steps.
-   The [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) shows an EOL alert
    for affected services.
-   Email reminders are sent to customers monthly.
-   In the month of the EOL date, the weekly reminders are sent to
    customers.

### EOL best practices
<!-- vale on -->

It's highly recommended to perform the version upgrade well before EOL
so that you can test the compatibility for any breaking changes, plan
for unforeseen issues, and migrate to the newer version on your own
schedule. After the EOL date:

1.  If the service is powered on, it's automatically upgraded to the
    latest version.
1.  If the service is powered off, it's deleted.

Aiven offers [database forking](/docs/platform/concepts/service-forking) as an efficient
tool to test the version upgrade before upgrading their production services.

## Aiven tools

Aiven offers multiple tools for interacting with the Aiven platform and
services. These include the Aiven CLI, the Aiven Provider for Terraform,
and the Aiven Operator for Kubernetes®.

Breaking changes in the Aiven API can result in new major versions of
the Aiven tools. While backwards compatibility is typically maintained,
certain changes require us to deprecate older versions of the tools.

Older versions will continue to work, but there will be no new features
or bug fixes after the EOL date.

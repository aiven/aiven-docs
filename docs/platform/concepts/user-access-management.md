title: User and access management
---

There are four types of users:

- [Super admin](/docs/platform/howto/make-super-admin): users with full access to the
  organization and are not subject to controls like authentication policies.
  Limit the number of these users in an organization for increased security.
- [Organization users](/docs/platform/howto/manage-org-users): all other users in an
  organization.
- [Managed users](/docs/platform/concepts/managed-users): users that have more
  restrictions and are centrally managed.
- [Application users](/docs/platform/concepts/application-users): Non-human users intended
  for programmatic access to the platform.

All users can be added to [groups](/docs/platform/howto/manage-groups) to help streamline
the process of granting access to organization resources. You grant access with
[roles and permissions](/docs/platform/concepts/permissions) at the project level.

title: User and access management
---

There are four types of users:

- Super admin: users with full access to the organization and are not subject to controls like
  authentication policies. Limit the number of these users in an organization for
  increased security.
- Organization users: all other users in an organization.
- Managed users: organization users become managed users when you verify a domain.
- Application users: Non-human users intended for programmatic access to the platform.

All users can be added to groups to help streamline the process of granting access
to organization resources. You grant access with roles and permissions
at the project level.

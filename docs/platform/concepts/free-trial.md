title: 30-day trials
---

Aiven offers a free trial for 30 days to explore the Aiven Data and AI Platform, including the [Aiven Console](/docs/tools/aiven-console), [API](/docs/tools/api), [CLI](/docs/tools/cli), [Aiven Provider for Terraform](/docs/tools/terraform), [Aiven Operator for Kubernetes®](/docs/tools/kubernetes), and the [Aiven services](/docs/products/services). You don't need a credit card to sign up.

## Trial features and limitations

Trial credits can be used for any paid services and plan sizes in any project. They can
also be used for paid features like virtual private cloud peering.

Trials include:

-   Up to 10 VMs
-   1 [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](/docs/platform/howto/manage-vpc-peering)
-   Up to 10 VPC peering connections

If you create services on the [free plan](/docs/platform/concepts/free-plan), they will
continue to run alongside your free 30-day trial without affecting your trial credits.
Free plan services also continue running after the trial has expired.

There are some limitations:

-   You can only have one trial.
-   Trial credits are added to a single
    [billing group](/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups). You cannot transfer them to
    another billing group.
-   You can't create new services if your remaining credits would be spent too quickly.

Services are automatically powered down after the trial ends or your credits run out. To
keep your services running, [add a payment card](/docs/platform/howto/manage-payment-card).

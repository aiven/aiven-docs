title: 30-day trials
---

Aiven offers a free trial for 30 days to explore the platform, including the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), [API](/docs/tools/api), [CLI](/docs/tools/cli), [Aiven Terraform provider](/docs/tools/terraform), and [Aiven Operator for Kubernetes](/docs/tools/kubernetes), and the [Aiven services](https://docs.aiven.io/). You don't need a credit card to sign up.

If you create services on the
[free plan](/docs/platform/concepts/free-plan), they will continue to run alongside your free 30-day trial
without affecting your trial credits. Free plan services also continue
running after the trial has expired.

## Trial features and limitations

The trial credits can be used for any paid services and plan sizes as
well functionality like virtual private cloud peering.

Trials include:

-   Up to 10 VMs
-   1 [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](/docs/platform/howto/manage-vpc-peering)
-   Up to 10 VPC peering connections

There are some limitations:

<!-- vale off -->

-   You can only have one trial
-   Trials can only be started in your default project, which is created
    when you sign up
-   Trial credits cannot be transferred to another project
-   You can't create new services if your remaining credits would be
    spent too quickly

<!-- vale on -->

## Add a payment card

To keep your services running after the trial period,
[add a payment card](/docs/platform/howto/manage-payment-card). Without a payment card, services are automatically powered
down after credits run out, but they can be powered on again after a
card is added.

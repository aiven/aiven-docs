title: Billing groups
---

Billing groups let you set up common billing profiles in an organization
that can then be used for any projects within that organization. This
includes projects in organizational units within that organization. So,
instead of entering the payment information every time you create a
project, you can use the information saved in the billing group.

This also makes it easier to manage your costs. You receive a
consolidated invoice for all projects assigned to a billing group. This
means you can, for instance, combine costs based on your organization or
IT environment (development, test, production) by creating billing
groups for each of these.

Organization billing groups can only be used in one organization. You
cannot use a billing group for projects that are in other organizations.
Aiven credits are also assigned to a billing group and are automatically
used to cover charges of any project assigned to that billing group.

To access billing groups, you must be a super admin or account owner.

You can also track spending by exporting cost information to business
intelligence tools using the [invoice
API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#tag/BillingGroup).

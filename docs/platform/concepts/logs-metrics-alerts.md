title: About logging, metrics and alerting
---

Administrators can configure log and metrics integrations to Aiven services so that you can monitor the health of your service.

## Logs

On the **Overview** page of your service, select **Integrations** to add
an integration that will send service logs to an Aiven for OpenSearch速
service. This can be an existing service, or you can choose to create a
new one.

## Metrics

On the **Overview** page of your service, select **Integrations** to set
up an integration to push service metrics to an M3 or
PostgreSQL速 service on Aiven. This can be an existing service or you can
create a new one to receive the metrics.

## Dashboards

You can create custom OpenSearch速 or Grafana速 dashboards to monitor the
service.

## Alerts

The platform has alert policies to notify you via email when a key metric
reaches or drifts from a threshold. For example, low memory or high CPU
consumption.

For information on setting the addresses for these emails, see
[Manage project and service notifications](/docs/platform/howto/technical-emails).

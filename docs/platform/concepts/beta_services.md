New services and features follow a release lifecycles that promotes feature quality.

The release workflow is:

1. **Limited availability** (private beta)
1. **Early availability** (public beta)
1. **General availability**

## Limited availability (private beta) <LimitedBadge/>

The limited availability (private beta) stage is an initial release of a
new functionality that you can try out by invitation only.

If you are interested in trying a service or feature in this stage, contact the
[sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io).

## Early availability (public beta) <EarlyBadge/>

Features and services in the early availability (public beta) stage are
released to all users with some restrictions on the functionality and
[service level agreement](https://aiven.io/sla).

They are intended for use in non-production environments, but you can test them with
production-like workloads to gauge their behavior under heavy load.

Issues raised for these services and features are considered
[low severity](https://aiven.io/support-services). You can provide feedback about the
feature.

You can enable most early availability features yourself
on the [feature preview page](/docs/platform/howto/feature-preview) in the user profile.

:::note
Using an early availability means that you consent to us contacting
you to request feedback. The feedback we receive helps us shape the products you use.

## General availability

New services and features become generally available once they are ready
for production use at scale. The duration of the early and limited
availability stages depends on the adoption of the service or feature by the users
and what changes are required to address the key issues that are discovered.

## Billing for limited and early availability services

Aiven provides credits for you to try out limited and early availability
services. After the credit code expires or after you have used the
credits, you are charged for the service at the usual rate.

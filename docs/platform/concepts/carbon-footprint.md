The carbon footprint page shows estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with service usage in your organization.

Emissions are measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent, which includes
multiple greenhouse gasses. The following information is shown on the dashboard:

- Estimated emissions this month: Shows an estimate of emissions for the current calendar month and the month-over-month change from the previous month.
- Estimated emissions this year: Shows an estimate of emissions for the current calendar year and the month-over-month change from the previous year.
- Monthly carbon emissions: Shows an estimate of the emissions broken down by month for up to 12 months. You can view trends for specific projects or services.

To view your emissions data, go to **Admin** > **Carbon footprint**.

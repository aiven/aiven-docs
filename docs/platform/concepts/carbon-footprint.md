The carbon footprint page shows estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with service usage per project in your organization.

Emissions are measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent, which includes
multiple greenhouse gasses. The following information is shown on the dashboard for the
selected project:

- Estimated emissions for the month: Shows a running estimate of emissions for the
  current calendar month.
- Monthly carbon emissions: Shows an estimate of the emissions for the last 3, 6, and
  12 months.

To view your emissions data, go to **Admin** > **Carbon footprint**.

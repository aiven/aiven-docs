Aiven services are usually deployed on Aiven-managed infrastructure,
using Aiven-managed security protocols, and backed by Aiven-managed
storage and backups. This provides the most seamless straightforward
de-risked approach to deploying Aiven services. However, you might need
a different configuration if your business, project, or organization has
specific requirements for strict regulatory compliance, fine-grained
network access control, or cloud purchase commitments in place, for
instance.

This is where the bring your own cloud (BYOC) feature comes in enabling
you to use your own cloud infrastructure instead of using the
Aiven-managed infrastructure. With BYOC, your Aiven organization gets
connected with your cloud provider account by creating custom clouds in
your Aiven organization. A custom cloud is a secure environment within
your cloud provider account to run Aiven-managed data services. By
enabling BYOC, creating custom clouds, and setting up Aiven services
within the custom clouds, you can manage your infrastructure on the
Aiven platform while keeping your data in your own cloud.

## Why use BYOC

Consider using BYOC and custom clouds if you have specific business
needs or project requirements. There are a few major reasons to use
BYOC:

-   **Compliance**: Aiven offers managed environments for several
    standard compliance regulations, such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.
    However, if you have strict regulatory requirements or special
    compliance requirements, BYOC may be the best option for you.
-   **Network auditing**: If you require the visibility of all traffic
    within any VPC you operate in or need frequent auditing
    capabilities, BYOC is potentially a good fit. BYOC gives you the
    ability to audit network metadata but not the actual contents.
-   **Fine-grained network control**: BYOC only requires specific
    network access for Aiven (for example, service management or
    troubleshooting) to deploy and manage open source data services,
    otherwise allowing you to customize your network to meet any
    internal requirements or requirements of your customers.
-   **Cost optimization**: Depending on your cloud provider, with BYOC
    you can use cost savings plans, committed use discounts, or other
    strategies to save on compute and storage infrastructure costs
    related to Aiven services.

## Who is eligible for BYOC {#eligible-for-byoc}

The BYOC setup is a bespoke service offered on a case-by-case basis, and
not all cloud providers support it yet. Meet a few requirements to be eligible for BYOC:

-   You use Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure (excluding
    Azure Germany).
-   You have a commitment deal with Aiven.
-   You have the [Advanced or Premium support tier](/docs/platform/howto/support).

    the [sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io)Â to learn more or upgrade your support tier.

## When to use the regular Aiven deployment

BYOC deployments are not automated, and they add additional complexity
to communicating to the Aiven control plane, service management, key
management, and security.

In most cases, you can meet your regulatory and business requirements by
utilizing a regular Aiven deployment or
[Enhanced Compliance Environment](/docs/platform/concepts/enhanced-compliance-env).

:::tip
If you would like to understand BYOC better or are unsure which
deployment model is the best fit for you, contact [the sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io).
:::

## BYOC pricing and billing

Unlike Aiven's standard all-inclusive pricing, the BYOC setup has
custom pricing depending on the nature of your requirements. If you
enter this arrangement, you are responsible for all cloud infrastructure
and network traffic charges.

You receive two separate monthly invoices, one from Aiven for their
managed services and another from the cloud service provider for the
cloud infrastructure costs. This enables you to use any cloud commit you
may have and potentially leverage committed use discounts (CUDs) in
certain cases.

## Standard BYOC architecture {#byoc-deployment}

With BYOC, you can use any standard Aiven method (for example,
[CLI](/docs/tools/cli) or
[Terraform](/docs/tools/terraform) to
manage your services and generally have the same user experience as with
the regular Aiven deployment model.

![Overview architecture diagram with VPC set up](/images/content/platform/byoc-one-vpc-arch.png)

The standard BYOC deployment requires you to create a Virtual Private Cloud
(**BYOC VPC**) dedicated to Aiven-managed services within a cloud region you
want to operate in. Aiven accesses this VPC from a static IP address and routes
traffic through a proxy for additional security. To accomplish this, Aiven
utilizes a bastion host physically separated from the Aiven services you deploy.
You are able to integrate your services using standard VPC peering techniques.

:::note
Although the bastion host and the service nodes reside in the VPC under
your management (**BYOC VPC**), they are not accessible (for example, via SSH) to anyone
outside Aiven.

The bastion and workload nodes require outbound access to the Internet
to work properly (supporting HA signaling to the Aiven management node and RPM download
from Aiven repositories).
:::

Depending on the service used, Aiven takes regular backups to enable
forking, point in time recovery (PITR), and disaster recovery. These
backups by default do not reside in your cloud. If there is a
requirement to have all backups in your own cloud, it's still possible.
To accomplish this, Aiven needs an object storage and read-write
permissions.

:::important
All backups are encrypted using Aiven-managed keys, and you are
responsible for managing object storage configurations.

title: Service resources
---

You may have noticed that services in Aiven have different resources
than the virtual machine (VM) it runs on. A number of Aiven plans,
particularly low-end ones, do not exactly match the resources virtual
machines provide in all clouds. The most significant differences are
with the **Hobbyist**, and **Startup-4** plans on **DigitalOcean**,
where the droplets typically have more resources (CPU, RAM, disk space)
than we advertise for our plans.

The reason is that our plans are defined in a way that allows us to
offer the same plans in all clouds, making it possible to migrate
workloads between the different clouds providers.

Resources available in each of the clouds vary, especially on the
smaller virtual machine sizes. Therefore we have defined our plans with
resources that we can provide for all clouds. Some plans may offer more
resources than advertised, but we reserve the right to scale down the
VMs used to implement the services in case the cloud providers introduce
more suitable VM types.

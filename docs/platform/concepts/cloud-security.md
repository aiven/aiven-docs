Learn about Aiven's access control, encryption, network security, data privacy and operator access.

## Cloud provider accounts

Aiven services are hosted under cloud provider accounts
controlled by Aiven.

These accounts are managed only by Aiven operations
personnel, and customers cannot directly access the Aiven cloud provider
account resources.

## Virtual machines

Each Aiven service consists of one or more virtual machines, which are
automatically launched to the target cloud region chosen by the
customer.

In cloud regions that have multiple Availability Zones (or a
similar mechanism), virtual machines are distributed evenly across
the zones to provide the best possible service in cases when an
entire availability zone (which can include one or more datacenters)
becomes unavailable.

Service-providing virtual machines (VMs) are dedicated to a single
customer. This means there is no multi-tenancy on a VM basis, and the customer
data never leaves the machine, except when uploaded to the offsite
backup location.

Virtual machines are not reused and are terminated and wiped during service
upgrade or termination.

## Data encryption

Aiven at-rest data encryption covers both active service instances as
well as service backups in cloud object storage.

Service instances and the underlying VMs use full volume encryption
using LUKS with a randomly generated ephemeral key per each instance and
each volume. The key is never re-used and will be trashed at the
destruction of the instance, so there's a natural key rotation with
roll-forward upgrades. We use the LUKS2 default mode
aes-xts-plain64:sha256 with a 512-bit key.

Backups are encrypted with a randomly generated key per file. These keys
are in turn encrypted with RSA key-encryption key-pair and stored in the
header section of each backup segment. The file encryption is performed
with AES-256 in CTR mode with HMAC-SHA256 for integrity protection. The
RSA key-pair is randomly generated for each service. The key lengths are
256-bit for block encryption, 512-bit for the integrity protection and
3072-bits for the RSA key.

Aiven-encrypted backup files are stored in the object storage in the
same region where the service virtual machines are located.

For cloud providers that do not provide object storage services like
DigitalOcean or UpCloud, the nearest region from another cloud provider
that provides an object storage is used.

## Networking security

Customer access to provided services is only provided over TLS encrypted
connections. There is no option for using unencrypted plaintext
connections.

Communication between virtual machines within Aiven is secured with
either TLS or IPsec. There are no unencrypted plaintext connections.

Virtual machine network interfaces are protected by a dynamically
configured iptables-based firewall that only allows connections from
specific addresses both from the internal network (other VMs in the same
service) or external public network (customer client connections). The
allowed source IP addresses for establishing connections are user
controlled on a per-service basis.

## Networking with VPC peering

When using VPC peering, no public internet based access is provided to
the services. Service addresses are published in public DNS, but they
can only be connected to from the customer's peered VPC using private
network addresses.

The services providing virtual machines are still contained under Aiven
cloud provider accounts. Aiven VPCs are created per project and not
shared between customers, organizations, organizational units, or
projects. When services are deployed in a VPC, the DNS names resolve to
their Private IP.

Some services allow both public and private access to be enabled while
inside a VPC and see
[Enable public access in a VPC](/docs/platform/howto/public-access-in-vpc).

Connections to Aiven services are always established from your VPC to
the peered Aiven VPC. So, you can use VPC firewall rules to prevent any
ingress connections from the Aiven side to your network.

## Operator access

Normally all the resources required for providing an Aiven service are
automatically created, maintained and terminated by the Aiven
infrastructure and there is no manual Aiven operator intervention
required.

However, the Aiven Operations Team has the capability to securely login
to the service Virtual Machines for troubleshooting purposes. These
accesses are audit logged.

No customer access to the virtual machine level is provided.

## Customer data privacy

Customer data privacy is of utmost importance to Aiven, and is covered
by internal security and customer privacy policies as well as strict EU
regulations.

Aiven has partnered with GitHub in scanning for service token leaks and
will inform customers of tokens being made public through an email
notification. For more details, check [Improving security: Aiven and
GitHub's secret scanning
partnership](https://aiven.io/blog/aiven-and-github's-secret-scanning-partnership).

Aiven operators never access customer data, unless explicitly requested
to do so by the customer in order to troubleshoot a technical issue.

Aiven operations team has mandatory recurring training regarding the
applicable policies.

## Periodic security evaluation

Aiven services are periodically assessed, and penetration tested for any
security issues by an independent professional cyber security vendor.

## Software bill of materials (SBOM)

The SBOM is a list of all packages that are being used by Aiven in the
services we provide. The list details packages installed in the VM
operating system, as well as packages installed by the service itself.

SBOM reports are being widely adopted and may eventually be required for
compliance or security assessments. We provide these reports as a file
download via the [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli), in CSV or SPDX format. To  get the SBOM
report download link for a project, run:

```bash
avn project generate-sbom --project PROJECT_NAME --output csv
```

SBOM reports are only available to customers who have an Enterprise
support contract and all services within the project must have the
latest maintenance patches applied.

## Time synchronization

All Aiven backend and customer services are configured to use trusted
NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers of the respective cloud provider
where each service is deployed.

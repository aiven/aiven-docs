title: Disaster recovery testing scenarios
---

Aiven provides disaster recovery testing services to help you plan for data center or platform outages.

An Aiven specialist simulates an issue with the virtual machines for a test
service in your environment. For example, they can test failovers when a primary
instance of your Aiven service fails and recovery times when there's
a complete outage.

## Prerequisites

- At least 7 working days' notice.
- A service created specifically for disaster recovery testing. This cannot be
  a service that's used in production.
- A [Premium support contract](/docs/platform/howto/support).

## Request a disaster recovery test

To request a test, contact the [sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io) or your account team
with the following information:

- The date and time, including time zone, of the test
- The virtual machine and availability zone to target

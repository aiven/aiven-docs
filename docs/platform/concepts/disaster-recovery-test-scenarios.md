title: Disaster recovery testing
---

Aiven provides disaster recovery testing services to help you plan for data center or service outages.

An Aiven specialist simulates an issue with the virtual machines for a test
service in your environment. For example, they can test failovers when a primary
instance of your Aiven service fails and recovery times when there's
a complete outage.

## Prerequisites

- The [Premium support tier](/docs/platform/howto/support)
- At least 7 working days' notice
- A service created specifically for disaster recovery testing. This cannot be
  a service that's used in production.

## Request a disaster recovery test

To request a test, contact the [sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io) or your account team
with the following information:

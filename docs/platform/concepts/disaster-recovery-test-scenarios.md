title: Disaster recovery testing
---

Aiven provides disaster recovery testing services to help you plan for data center or service outages.

An Aiven specialist simulates an issue with the virtual machines for a test
service in your environment. For example, they can test failovers when a primary
instance of your Aiven service fails and recovery times when there's
a complete outage.

## Prerequisites

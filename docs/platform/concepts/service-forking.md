title: Service forking
---

[Fork your Aiven service](/docs/platform/howto/console-fork-service) in order to make a copy of the service. You can use it to
create a development copy of your production environment, set up a
snapshot to analyze an issue or test an upgrade, or create an instance
in a different cloud/geographical location/under a different plan.

When you fork a service, the following items are copied into the new
service:

-   Configurations
-   Databases
-   Service users
-   Connection pools

Forking a service does not cause any additional load to it, because the
new fork does not communicate with the original service. The data is
restored from the latest backup stored separately from the service.

:::warning
The service integrations are not copied over to the forked version, and
need to be re-established for each new copy.
:::

You can fork the following Aiven services:

-   PostgreSQL®

-   MySQL

-   Redis®\*

-   Apache Cassandra® (Limitation: you cannot fork to a lower amount of
    nodes)

-   Elasticsearch

-   OpenSearch®

    :::important
    When you fork an Aiven for OpenSearch® service, any Single Sign-On
    (SSO) methods configured at the service level, such as SAML, must be
    explicitly reconfigured for the forked service. SSO configurations
    are linked to specific URLs and endpoints, which change during
    forking. Failing to reconfigure SSO methods for the forked service
    can lead to authentication problems and potentially disrupt user
    access.
    :::

-   M3DB

-   Grafana®

When forking a service with Point in Time Recovery (PITR), you can
choose to fork from the latest transaction or select a specific point in
the past to fork from.

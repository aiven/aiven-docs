title: Billing groups
---

Billing groups store your billing details in one place, letting you use the same payment and other information across projects within your organization, including those in organizational units.

You can use billing groups to combine costs based on categories like your organization's
departments or IT environments. You receive a [consolidated invoice](/docs/platform/concepts/billing-and-payment) for all projects assigned to a billing group. Aiven credits
are also assigned to a billing group and are automatically used to cover charges
of any project assigned to that billing group.

You can only use a billing group for payments in one organization. You
cannot use a billing group for projects that are in other organizations.

To access billing groups in the Aiven Console, you must be a
[super admin](/docs/platform/howto/make-super-admin) or account owner.

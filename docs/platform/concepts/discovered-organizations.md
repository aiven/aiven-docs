The discovered organizations feature lets organization admin identify other Aiven organizations that [managed users](/docs/platform/concepts/managed-users) have joined using the same email address associated with one of your verified domains.

This visibility helps you monitor external memberships and maintain organizational
security. It provides insight into the organizations managed users are part of
as well as any organizations they independently created before becoming managed users.

The discovered organizations page lists the organizations and the managed users
that joined them. Managed users who are super admin of another organization are
also identified, so you can contact them to remove or modify the organization to
comply with your internal security policies.

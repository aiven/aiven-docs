title: Roles and permissions
---

To give users access to projects and services in your organizations, you grant them permissions and roles:

* **Permissions**: Actions that a principal can perform on a resource or
  group of resources.
* **Roles**: Sets of permissions that you can assign to a principal.

Principals are
[organization users](/docs/platform/howto/manage-org-users),
[application users](/docs/platform/concepts/application-users),
and [groups](/docs/platform/howto/list-groups).
You can grant access to principals at the project level. You can
[add users to services](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service_user).

To grant access to resources at the organization level, you can
make organization users [super admin](/docs/platform/howto/make-super-admin).
Limit the number of users with this role as it gives unrestricted access to
all organization resources including billing, admin, and all projects and services.

## Project roles

You can grant the following roles for projects to principals.

Project admin do not have access to organization settings such as billing unless
they are also a [super admin](/docs/platform/howto/make-super-admin).

## Project and service permissions

:::important
Permissions are not yet fully supported in the Aiven Console. They are intended for
use with the Aiven API, Aiven Provider for Terraform, and Aiven Operator for Kubernetes速.

You can grant the following permissions to principals. The actions listed for each
permission apply to the project and all services within it.

title: Tax information for Aiven services
---

Aiven services are provided by Aiven Ltd, a private limited company incorporated in Finland, but operating in various countries. None of Aiven's marketed prices include value-added or other taxes.

## Aiven's tax status

Aiven has the following tax status in the jurisdictions it operates in.

### European Union

Finnish law requires Aiven to charge a value-added tax for services
provided within the European Union. The value-added tax percentage
depends on the domicile of the customer.

For business customers in EU countries other than Finland, Aiven can apply
the reverse charge mechanism of 2006/112/EC article 196 when a valid VAT
ID
[is added to a billing group](#add-a-vat-id-to-a-billing-group) for a billing group.

### United States
<!-- vale off -->
According to the tax treaty between Finland and the United States,
no direct tax needs to be withheld from payments by American entities to
Aiven. Although a W-8 form is not required to confirm this status,
we're happy to provide a W-8BEN-E form describing Aiven's status.
Contact [billing@aiven.io](mailto:billing@aiven.io) to request one.

Aiven charges American sales taxes in several states in the United-States. The
applicability of these taxes depends on various factors, such as the
taxability of Aiven services, tax thresholds, amongst others.

### Rest of the world

No European Uninion value-added tax is applied to services sold outside the
European Union as described in the Value-Added Tax Act of Finland section 69h.
Finland has tax treaties with most countries in the world affirming this status.
Aiven reserves the right to charge any necessary taxes, similar to American
sales taxes, depending on the local tax legislation of the customer.

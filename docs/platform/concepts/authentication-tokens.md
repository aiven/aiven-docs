title: Tokens
---

There are 3 types of tokens used to access the Aiven platform: session tokens, personal tokens, and application tokens.

Session tokens are created when you log in or make an API call. These tokens are revoked
when you log out of the Aiven Console or the CLI.

You can [create personal tokens](/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token) to
access resources instead of using your password.
Application tokens are linked to
[application users](/docs/platform/concepts/application-users). Application users and
tokens are a more secure option for non-human users like external applications. You can
create multiple personal or application tokens for different use cases.

To keep your personal and application tokens secure:

- Set a session duration to limit the impact of exposure
- Refrain from letting users share tokens
- Rotate your tokens regularly
- Restrict usage to trusted networks by specifying an allowed IP address range
- Use application users for non-human users and follow
  [security best practices](/docs/platform/concepts/application-users) for their tokens
- Control access to your organization's resources with the
  [authentication policy](/docs/platform/howto/set-authentication-policies)

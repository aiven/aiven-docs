title: Authentication tokens
---

An authentication token allows a user to programmatically access
resources instead of using their username and password. The usage of
authentication tokens rather than user credentials has many benefits:

-   Multiple tokens can be generated for different apps or use cases
    unlike a single set of user credentials for everything.
-   The limited lifespan of authentication tokens reduce the security
    risk of being exposed.

  Client->>+Server: Here's my username/password. Give me a token.
  Server-->>-Client: Your username/password is valid. Here's a token.
  Client->>+Server: Here's a token. Show me a list of my resources.
  Server-->>-Client: Your token is valid. Here's a list of your resources.
```

## How Aiven manages user sessions using authentication tokens

Each time a user signs in to Aiven either via [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/), Aiven command line client, or
direct REST API call, the server creates a new authentication token
associated with the user.

The user can configure the expiry when requesting the token. It is also
possible to configure the token to extend its expiry when it is used, so
that it will remain valid while it is in active use.

## Token counts

The system has hard limits for how many valid authentication tokens are
allowed per user. This limit is different for tokens that are created as
a result of sign in operation and for tokens created explicitly. The max
token count is **10** for user created tokens but the system never
invalidates the tokens unless they expire or they are explicitly
revoked. For automatically created tokens the limit is **1000** but when
this limit is reached the system automatically deletes tokens that have
been used least recently to avoid going above the limit.

Therefore, an old token can stop working even if it hasn't expired nor
been explicitly revoked. To avoid running into problems with this
behavior, configure your tokens with expiry times that suit their use
case. This is mostly relevant for automation which automatically creates
a new token each time it runs. [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) automatically revokes the current
token when signing out and the Aiven command line client also provides a
sign out command (`avn user logout`).

## Considerations for working with tokens

### Limit token expiry

Think about how long the token needs to be valid for; this varies
depending on what the token is used for.
<!-- vale off -->
-   If you're doing a video recording for a demo, you can set the token
    to expire in an hour. This means that even if you have exposed the
    token during your work, it will no longer work by the time the video
    is published.
-   For server-side use within the build process, such as on the CI
    server, a token with long-term validity and/or refresh interval is
    appropriate.
-   For a situation where the token could ever be accessible, keep the
    expiry time short, and generate a new token for each operation.
<!-- vale on -->
The longer a token lives, the higher the risk of exposure. Follow the IT
security best practises established by your company and refrain from
allowing human users to share the same token.

### Use appropriate user accounts

Especially when working with tokens for automation rather than personal
or one-off use, generate the tokens for a user account that has the
appropriate access permissions that the tokens should have. If you are
the admin, then it is not recommended to give a token for your own
account to automation services that may only need read access.

### Rotate tokens regularly

It is also good practice to rotate your authorization tokens on a
regular basis, for example each month. You can have as many tokens
active at one time as you need, so you can create a new token, replace
it as needed, check everything works, and remove the old token once
you are confident that all changes have completed successfully.

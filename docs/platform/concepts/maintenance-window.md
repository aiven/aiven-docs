title: Service maintenance

## Maintenance window

The **maintenance window** is a time window during which the nodes
behind Aiven services are switched to new upgraded version and, once the
process is completed, the overall URI DNS name is pointed at the new
location.

The upgrade is done during the maintenance window that you can set from
the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), in the service details page.
During the maintenance window, some services might have minimal downtime.

:::note
For example, when a mandatory service update for Apache Kafka® is released,
the [Kafka upgrade procedure](/docs/products/kafka/concepts/upgrade-procedure)
is executed.
:::

Aiven service upgrades are performed in rolling forward style, which
means that new service nodes are first created alongside with the older
nodes one at a time, after which the old nodes are retired.

For **MySQL®**, **PostgreSQL®** and **Redis®**\*, the maintenance
window usually lasts around several seconds. The downtime comes from old
master stopping itself in a controlled manner and new master executing
promotion sequence after this. Once the promotion is complete the old
master node starts forwarding requests to the new master node so the
service is accessible before DNS updates are propagated, though clients
that end up reconnecting to the old master node will see additional
disconnection once the old master is permanently retired.

For **Apache Kafka®** and **OpenSearch®**, the service DNS address
resolves to all the available service nodes. During an upgrade the DNS
address changes to reflect the added and removed nodes. For example,
during an [Apache Kafka upgrade
procedure](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/products/kafka/concepts/upgrade-procedure.html),
a three node plan will have a minimum of three nodes available at all
times during the whole upgrade operation.

:::note
While the DNS name remains the same, the IP address it points to, will
change during a maintenance break. To know more about static IP
addresses, check the
[related documentation](static-ips).

:::note
Starting with Aiven for OpenSearch® versions 1.3.13 and 2.10, OpenSearch
Dashboards will remain available during a maintenance update that also
consists of version updates to your Aiven for OpenSearch service.

## Maintenance updates

Security updates, platform updates that affect reliability or stability
of the service nodes, and quarterly patch updates are always mandatory.
Other updates are initially optional. Advance notice is given for all
updates. After optional updates have been available for six months, they
become mandatory and are applied on the next week's maintenance window
at the earliest. This means you have at least 7 days advance notice with
exception of critical security updates. These critical updates are
applied in the maintenance window of the current week. During service
upgrades, maintenance updates are automatically applied and do not
require any action from you.

You can view maintenance updates pending for your service using the
following:

-   [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) > **Service settings**
    page > **Service management** section
-   `avn service get` command in [Aiven
    CLI](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn-service-get)
-   `service` endpoint in [Aiven REST
    API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#tag/Service/operation/ServiceGet)

## Periodic infrastructure updates

Maintenance updates are scheduled automatically for services with nodes
active for 180 days and more.

:::important
Periodic infrastructure updates are mandatory for all the services
except for those with maintenance disabled.

## About BTAR

The backup to another region (BTAR) feature allows existing backup files to be copied from
the service's primary backup region to an additional (secondary) region. As a disaster
recovery feature, BTAR is particularly useful when the service-hosting region is down
since it allows forking the service from an additional copy of the backup residing outside
the service-hosting region.

BTAR is currently supported for the following services:

- Aiven for PostgreSQL®
- Aiven for MySQL®

## Why use BTAR

BTAR provides an additional level of data resilience, helping you make your data safe and
protected. BTAR is a cost-efficient low-complexity disaster recovery feature that allows
you to replicate your data in a secondary backup region and recover it there in case of
outage, downtime, data loss, or data corruption in the primary backup region.

## How BTAR works

By enabling the backup to another region (BTAR) feature, you create a service backup that
is additional to the default backup. This secondary backup is always located in a region
of your choice different from the primary backup region.

Secondary backups are generated from primary backups, not from the service itself. For
this reason, your secondary backup becomes available only after the primary backup is
taken. There might be a data replication lag between the primary region and the secondary
region.

Restoring from a secondary backup, for example in case of an outage of the primary region,
can be done by creating a fork of the service in the region where the secondary backup is
located.

    Service_X -- Default \n backups --> Primary_backups
    Primary_backups -- Cross-region backups \n if BTAR  enabled --> Secondary_backups
    Secondary_backups -- Secondary backups \n to restore service X --> Forked_service_X
    Service_X -- Forking service X \n if primary region down --> Forked_service_X
```

## Limitations

- When selecting a cloud region for your additional backup, you need to use the same cloud
  provider that your service uses.
- When you want to
  [restore your service from an additional backup](/docs/platform/howto/btar/manage-backup-to-another-region)
  and you use a point in time to specify the scope of data to be restored, you need to set
  up the time to no later than the time of the latest backup.
- Secondary backup can only be restored in the region where it was stored.
- Secondary backup is generated only after a primary backup is complete, and there might
  be a data replication lag between the primary region and the secondary region.

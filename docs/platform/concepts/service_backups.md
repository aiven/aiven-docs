Most services have automatic time-based backups that are encrypted and securely stored.

**Backed-up services:** All Aiven services, except for Apache Kafka® and M3
Aggregator/Coordinator.

**Backup location:** Backups are stored in the object storage of the cloud region
where the service is first created, for example, S3 for AWS or GCS for GCP.

## Display service backups

1. In the Aiven Console, open the service of your choice.
1. Click <ConsoleLabel name="backups"/>.

:::note
Backups are encrypted and not available for download.

If you change a service's cloud provider or an availability zone,
its backups are not migrated from their original location.
:::

## Service power-off/on backup policy

Whenever a service is powered on from a powered-off state, the latest available
backup is automatically restored.

:::note
<AutoDelete/>

See [Power a service on/off](/docs/platform/concepts/service-power-cycle).
:::

## Service backup deletion policy and service recovery

A service's backups are automatically deleted <strong>{Variables.backup_policy} days</strong> after the service's deletion date.

To recover a service, contact [support@aiven.io](mailto:support@aiven.io).

:::note
This operation may incur an additional cost to your project.

## Access to backups

Backups are encrypted and not available for download, but you can create your own
backups with the appropriate tooling:

-   [PostgreSQL®](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/app-pgdump.html):
    `pgdump`
-   [MySQL®](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html):
    `mysqldump`
-   [Redis®\*](https://redis.io/docs/connect/cli/#remote-backups-of-rdb-files):
    `redis-cli`
-   [Cassandra®](https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cql/3.3/cql/cql_reference/cqlshCopy.html)
    `cqlsh`
-   [OpenSearch®](https://github.com/elasticsearch-dump/elasticsearch-dump):
    `elasticdump`

:::note
These tools are recommendations and are not intended
to create a snapshot of your Aiven service but to provide access to the
data.

There are specific backup strategies for particular service types.

### Aiven for Apache Kafka®

Aiven for Apache Kafka is usually used as a transport tool for data
rather than a permanent store. Due to the way it stores data,
traditional backup strategies are not feasible. As a result, Aiven does
not perform backups for managed Apache Kafka services, and data
durability is determined by data replication across the cluster.

However, automatic backups for essential Apache Kafka® service
configurations are offered through
[configuration backups](/docs/products/kafka/concepts/configuration-backup), and
they come at no extra cost. If the Apache Kafka®
service is powered off/on or if any incidents lead to the cluster's
failure, the configuration backup facilitates restoring your Apache
Kafka® service to its previous state.

To back up data passing through Apache Kafka, we recommend using one of
the following tools:

- [MirrorMaker 2](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-mirrormaker) to replicate the data to
  another cluster, which can be
  an Aiven service or a Apache Kafka cluster on your own
  infrastructure.

  With MirrorMaker 2, the backup cluster operates as
  an independent Apache Kafka service. You can freely choose a zone
  for your backup service since it operates independently from the
  primary service.

  :::note
  MirrorMaker 2 provides tools for mapping between the source and
  target offset, so you don't need to make this calculation. For more
  details, see section *Offset Mapping* in
  [A look inside Kafka MirrorMaker 2](https://blog.cloudera.com/a-look-inside-kafka-mirrormaker-2/).
  :::

- Kafka Connect to backup the cluster, for instance, sinking data from
  Apache Kafka® to S3 via a
  [dedicated Aiven connector](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/s3-sink-prereq).

For more information, refer to:

- [Aiven for Apache Kafka® MirrorMaker 2](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-mirrormaker)
- Cloudera's [A look inside Kafka MirrorMaker 2](https://blog.cloudera.com/a-look-inside-kafka-mirrormaker-2/)
- [Configure AWS for an S3 sink connector](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/s3-sink-prereq)
- [Configuration Backups](/docs/products/kafka/concepts/configuration-backup)

### Aiven for PostgreSQL®

For Aiven for PostgreSQL, full daily backups are taken, and WAL segments
are constantly archived to the cloud object storage. In case of node
failure,

- For a business or premium plan, Aiven can reconstruct the latest
  state from a replica.
- For a startup plan, Aiven can reconstruct the latest state from the
  latest base backup and replay the latest WAL segments on top of
  that.

You can supplement this with a remote read-only replica service, which
you can run in a different cloud region or with another cloud provider
and promote to master if needed.

- [High availability](/docs/products/postgresql/concepts/high-availability)
- [Create and use read-only replicas](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/create-read-replica)

### Aiven for MySQL®

Aiven for MySQL databases are automatically backed up with full daily
backups and binary logs recorded continuously. All backups are encrypted
with the open source [myhoard](https://github.com/aiven/myhoard)
software. Myhoard uses [Percona XtraBackup](https://www.percona.com/)
internally for taking full (or incremental) snapshots for MySQL.

#### Edit the backup schedule

<EditBackUpSchedule/>

For more information, refer to [MySQL Backups](/docs/products/mysql/concepts/mysql-backups).

### Aiven for OpenSearch®

Aiven for OpenSearch databases are automatically backed up, encrypted,
and stored securely in the object storage. The backups are taken every
hour, and the retention period varies based on the service plan.

For more information, see:

- [OpenSearch backups](/docs/products/opensearch/concepts/backups)
- [How to restore an OpenSearch® backup](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/restore_opensearch_backup)

### Aiven for Apache Cassandra®

Aiven for Apache Cassandra backups are taken every 24 hours. The
point-in-time recovery (PITR) feature is currently not available.

:::note
To be notified once the PITR feature is available for Cassandra, contact the Aiven support.
:::

### Aiven for Redis™\*

Aiven for Redis backups are taken every 12 hours.

For persistence, Aiven supports Redis Database Backup (RDB).

You can control the persistence feature using `redis_persistence` under
**Advanced configuration** in [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/)
(the service's **Service settings** page):

- When `redis_persistence` is set to `rdb`, Redis does RDB dumps every
  10 minutes if any key is changed. Also, RDB dumps are done according
  to the backup schedule for backup purposes.
- When `redis_persistence` is `off`, no RDB dumps or backups are done,
  so data can be lost at any moment if the service is restarted for
  any reason or if the service is powered off. This also means the
  service can't be forked.

:::note
AOF persistence is currently not supported by Aiven for the managed
Redis service.
:::

### Aiven for ClickHouse®

Aiven for ClickHouse® provides automatic daily backups. The
[Astacus](https://github.com/aiven/astacus) backup manager for
distributed databases runs on all nodes to coordinate backups of cluster
databases.

Each file to be backed up is encrypted, compressed, and uploaded to an
object storage (Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage) in the same region.

Aiven for ClickHouse backups contain database lists, table schemas,
table content, and access entities (such as users or roles). They are
backed up incrementally: files already present in the object storage are
not re-uploaded and only changed parts are backed up.

:::note
Aiven for ClickHouse doesn't support so-called streaming backups: when
a service is powered off, all data written after the last backup gets
lost.

For more information about limitations on Aiven for ClickHouse
backups, see
[Aiven for ClickHouse limitations](/docs/products/clickhouse/reference/limitations).

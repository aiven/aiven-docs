The managed users feature lets you centrally manage your organization's users, including editing their profiles, resetting passwords, and [setting authentication policies](/docs/platform/howto/set-authentication-policies).

A managed user cannot create new organizations
unless they are a [super admin](/docs/platform/howto/make-super-admin) of the organization.

## Make organizations user managed users

To make your users managed users, [verify a domain](/docs/platform/howto/manage-domains).
Users in an organization with a verified domain automatically become managed users.

## View all managed users in an organization

1. Click **Admin** > **Users**.

## Deactivate a managed user

1. Click **Admin**.
1. Select **Users**.
1. Find the user that you want to deactivate.
1. Click <ActionsIcon className="icon"/> **Actions** > **Deactivate**.

You can follow the same process to reactivate the user.

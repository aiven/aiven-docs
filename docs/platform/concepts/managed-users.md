title: Managed users
---

The managed users feature provides a centralized way of managing all of your organization's users, including editing their profiles, resetting passwords, and [setting authentication policies](/docs/platform/howto/set-authentication-policies).

When you [verify a domain](/docs/platform/howto/manage-domains), existing organization
users automatically become managed users. A managed user cannot create new organizations
unless they are a [super admin](/docs/platform/howto/make-super-admin) of the organization
that they are managed by.

## View all managed users in an organization

1. Click **Admin**.

1. Select **Users**.


## Deactivate a managed user

1. Click **Admin**.

1. Select **Users**.

1. Find the user that you want to deactivate.

1. Open the **Actions** menu and select **Deactivate**.

You can follow the same process to reactivate the user.

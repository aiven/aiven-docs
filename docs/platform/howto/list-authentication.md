title: Authentication methods
---

Users can authenticate to the Aiven platform using a password, single sign-on (SSO), or [tokens](/docs/platform/concepts/authentication-tokens). The available authentication methods depend on the organization's [authentication policy](/docs/platform/howto/set-authentication-policies).

Organization admin set these policies to restrict or require specific
authentication methods for all users in an organization. They can also set up SSO
through their preferred [identity provider](/docs/platform/howto/list-identity-providers).
For an additional layer of security,  Aiven also supports
[two-factor authentication](/docs/platform/howto/set-authentication-policies).

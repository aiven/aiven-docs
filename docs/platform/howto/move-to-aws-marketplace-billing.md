title: Move from Aiven direct billing to AWS Marketplace
---

Aiven makes its services available through the AWS Marketplace. If you already have some services running in a project, which is billed directly through Aiven, you can move to an AWS Marketplace subscription without disrupting your services.

1. [Set up AWS Marketplace for Aiven services](/docs/marketplace-setup).
   The new Aiven organization will contain your projects.

1. Collect the required information:

   1. From your **existing Aiven account**, retrieve The name of the Aiven projects
      that contain the services you wish to move.

   1. From your **new Aiven organization** with the AWS Marketplace
      subscription, retrieve the Aiven organization name.

1. Send the information by email to [the sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io).

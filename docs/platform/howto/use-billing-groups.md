Costs associated with services and features in an Aiven project are charged to the payment method assigned to its [billing group](/docs/platform/concepts/billing-and-payment#billing-groups).

Billing groups let you set up billing profiles and use them across different projects
in your organization. A consolidated [invoice](/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups)
is created for each billing group.

## Create a billing group

You must be an
[organization admin](/docs/platform/concepts/permissions#organization-roles-and-permissions)
to access this feature in the Aiven Console.

1.  In the organization, click **Billing**.
1.  Click <ConsoleLabel name="billinggroups"/>.
1.  Click **Create billing group**.
1.  Enter a name for the billing group and click **Continue**.
1.  Enter the billing details. You can also copy these details from
    another billing group by selecting it from the list. Click
    **Continue**.
1.  Select the projects to add to this billing group. You
    can also skip this and add projects later. Click **Continue**.
1.  Check the information in the **Summary** step. To make changes to
    any section, click **Edit**.
1.  When you have confirmed everything is correct, click **Create**.

## Rename a billing group

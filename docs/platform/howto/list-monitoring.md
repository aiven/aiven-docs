Use metrics, logs, alerts, and dashboards to monitor the health of your services and integrations.

- Metrics: Real-time information about your services.
- Logs: Available for services and integrations.
- Alerts: Receive emails and in-app [notifications](/docs/platform/howto/technical-emails).

## View service metrics

The service metrics available in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) include the following:

-   **CPU usage:** Shows the percentage of CPU resources consumed by the
    service.
-   **Disk space usage:** Represents the percentage of disk space
    utilized by the service.
-   **Disk iops (reads):** Indicates the input/output operations per
    second (IOPS) for disk reads.
-   **Disk iops (writes):** Indicates the input/output operations per
    second (IOPS) for disk writes.
-   **Load average:** Shows the 5-minute average CPU load, indicating
    the system's computational load.
-   **Memory usage:** Represents the percentage of memory resources
    utilized by the service.
-   **Network received:** Indicates the amount of network traffic
    received by the service, measured in bytes per second.
-   **Network transmitted:** Indicates the amount of network traffic
    transmitted by the service, also measured in bytes per second.

To view the metrics:

1. Open the service.
1. Click <ConsoleLabel name="metrics"/>.

To retrieve service logs with the CLI,
use [service metrics](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn-service-metrics).

## View service logs

:::note[Log retention]
Service logs are generally retained for a few days, and for some Aiven services
up to 14 days.

To control retention time, set up a log integration with an Aiven for OpenSearch速
service. The integration allows you to configure longer retention times for your
service logs, only limited by the disk space available on the Aiven for
OpenSearch速 plan you have selected.

OpenSearch速 together with OpenSearch速
Dashboards offers comprehensive logs browsing and analytics platform.

## Export service metrics and logs

You can export logs and metrics **to an Aiven service**:

- Send logs to [Aiven for Opensearch](/docs/products/opensearch/dashboards).
- Send logs to [Aiven for M3](/docs/products/m3db).
- Visualize logs with [Aiven for Grafana](/docs/products/grafana).

You can also export the data **to external tools**, see [metrics integrations](/docs/platform/howto/metrics-integrations).

## Set up alerts and notfications

## About renaming custom clouds

With the BYOC feature enabled, you can
[create custom clouds](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/create-custom-cloud) in your Aiven
organizations. While
[setting up a custom cloud in Aiven](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/create-custom-cloud), you
specify its name, which is a part of the initial custom
cloud's configuration. Later, you can come back to the **Rename**
setting in your cloud's page in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) and update the name you initially
specified.

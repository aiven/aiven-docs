Select your organizations, units, or project that can access and use your [custom cloud](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc).

With the [BYOC feature enabled](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/enable-byoc), you can
[create custom clouds](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/create-custom-cloud) in your Aiven
organization. As a part of the
[initial custom cloud's setup](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/create-custom-cloud),
you select in what projects you'll be able to use your new custom cloud to host Aiven
services. You can update this setting any time later by following
by following
[Enable projects to use your custom cloud](#enable-projects-to-use-your-custom-cloud).

You can make your custom cloud available by default in all existing and future projects,
or you can pick specific projects and/or organizational units where you want your custom
cloud to be available.

Update the list of customer contacts for your [custom cloud](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc).

## About updating customer contacts

With the BYOC feature enabled, you can
[create custom clouds](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/create-custom-cloud) in your Aiven
organizations. While creating a custom cloud in Aiven, add at least the
**Admin** contact. Later, you can come back to the the **Customer contact**
setting in your cloud's page in [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) and update the
contacts list you initially created for your cloud.

:::important
While you can add multiple different customer contacts for your custom cloud, **Admin** is
a mandatory role that is always required as a primary support contact.

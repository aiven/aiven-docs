## About updating customer contacts

With the BYOC feature enabled, you can
[create custom clouds](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/create-custom-cloud) in your Aiven organizations. While setting up a custom cloud
in Aiven, you add customer contacts for this cloud, which is a part of
the initial custom cloud's configuration. Later, you can come back to
the the **Customer contact** setting in your cloud's page in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) and update the contacts list you
initially created for your cloud.

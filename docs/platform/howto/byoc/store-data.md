Depending on your cloud provider, data in your custom cloud can be stored either in Aiven-owned cloud or in your own cloud account, the latter being currently allowed with AWS only.

## BYOC tiered storage

:::important
[BYOC](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc) tiered storage is only supported in AWS custom clouds for
[Aiven for Apache Kafka](/docs/products/kafka/howto/kafka-tiered-storage-get-started) and
[Aiven for ClickHouse](/docs/products/clickhouse/concepts/clickhouse-tiered-storage).
:::

To store data, AWS [BYOC](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc) environments use tiered storage, a
data allocation mechanism for improved efficiency and cost optimization of data management.
When enabled, tiered storage allows moving data automatically between hot storage (for
frequently accessed, critical, and often updated data) and cold storage (for rarely
accessed, static, or archived data).

Cold data of AWS-BYOC-hosted services is stored in object storage in your own AWS cloud
account. One S3 bucket is created per custom cloud.

:::note

- Tiered storage enabled on non-BYOC services is owned by Aiven and as such doesn't allow
  to store cold data in your own cloud account.
- Non-BYOC services with Aiven-owned tiered storage cannot be migrated to BYOC.

:::

To use tiered storage in an AWS-BYOC-hosted service, tiered storage needs to be enabled both
[in your custom cloud](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/store-data#enable-tiered-storage-in-a-custom-cloud)
and
[in the BYOC-hosted service](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/store-data#enable-tiered-storage-on-a-service).

## Enable tiered storage in a custom cloud

- **New AWS custom clouds**: Tiered storage is enabled by default in all new AWS custom
  clouds so you can proceed to
  [enabling tiered storage on a service](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/store-data#enable-tiered-storage-on-a-service).
- **Existing AWS custom clouds with no tiered storage support**:
  [Contact the Aiven support team](mailto:support@aiven.io) to request enabling tiered
  storage in your custom cloud.

## Enable tiered storage on a service

### Prerequisites

- At least one AWS [custom cloud](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/create-custom-cloud)
- At least one [Aiven-manged service](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service), either
  Aiven for Apache Kafka® or Aiven for ClickHouse®, hosted in an AWS custom cloud

  :::note
  If your Aiven-managed service is not hosted in a custom cloud, you can
  [migrate it](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/manage-byoc-service#migrate-an-existing-service-to-a-custom-cloud).
  :::

### Activate tiered storage

- [Enable for Aiven for Apache Kafka](/docs/products/kafka/howto/enable-kafka-tiered-storage)
- [Enable for Aiven for Clickhouse](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/enable-tiered-storage)

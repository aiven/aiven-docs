Find out whether your custom cloud is ready to use by viewing its status.

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) as an
    administrator, and go to an organization.
1.  From the top navigation bar, select **Admin**.
1.  From the left sidebar, select <ConsoleLabel name="bringyourowncloud"/>.
1.  In the **Bring your own cloud** view, identify your new cloud on the
    list of available clouds and check its status in the **Status**
    column.

When your custom cloud's status is **Active**, its deployment has been completed. Your
custom cloud is ready to use and you can see it on the list of your custom clouds in the
**Bring your own cloud** view.

Now you can

or

if your service and networking configuration allows it. For more information on migrating
your existing services to the custom cloud, contact your account team.

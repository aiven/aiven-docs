Find out whether your custom cloud is ready to use by viewing its status.

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) as an
    administrator, and go to an organization.
1.  From the top navigation bar, select **Admin**.
1.  From the left sidebar, select <ConsoleLabel name="bringyourowncloud"/>.
1.  In the **Bring your own cloud** view, identify your new cloud on the
    list of available clouds and check its status in the **Status**
    column.

When your custom cloud's status is **Active**, its deployment has been completed. Your
custom cloud is ready to use and you can see it on the list of your custom clouds in the
**Bring your own cloud** view. Now you can create new services in the custom cloud or
migrate your existing services to the custom cloud if your service and networking
configuration allows it. For more information on migrating your existing services to the
custom cloud, contact your account team.

Delete a [custom cloud](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc) so that it's no longer available in your Aiven organization, units, or projects.

After deleting a custom cloud, the data co-hosted in this cloud will no
longer be available from the Aiven platform. Before deleting your custom
cloud, make sure there are no active services using this cloud.

### Impact on your Aiven resources

The deletion impacts mostly resources on the Aiven site, such as cloud
configuration files.

### Impact on your remote cloud resources

A bastion service and the corresponding compute instance are deleted as a
consequence of your custom cloud's removal. As for resources created
when applying the Terraform template to create the custom cloud, they
are not removed after deleting the custom cloud. Unless you've removed
them earlier, you're advised to do that after deleting your cloud.

custom cloud.

```bash
avn byoc delete                               \

:::important
Remember to remove the resources created in your remote cloud account when
applying the Terraform template to create the custom cloud. They are not
removed automatically after deleting the cloud. Unless you've removed
them earlier, use the `terraform destroy` command to delete them. See
the guidelines on how to use the `destroy` command in [Command:
destroy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/destroy).

:::note
When running `terraform destroy`, add `-var-file=FILE_NAME.vars` as an option.

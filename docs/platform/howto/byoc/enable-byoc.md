Enabling [the bring your own cloud (BYOC) feature](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc) allows you to [create custom clouds](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/create-custom-cloud) in your Aiven organization. For more information on BYOC and custom clouds, check [Bring your own cloud (BYOC)](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc).

:::note
Enabling
[the BYOC feature](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc) or creating custom clouds in your
Aiven environment does not
affect the configuration of your existing Aiven organizations, projects,
or services. This only allows you to run Aiven services in your cloud
provider account.

## About enabling BYOC

To be able to create custom clouds on the Aiven platform, first you need
to enable the BYOC feature. [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/)
offers a quick and easy way to set up a short call with the Aiven sales
team to identify your use cases and confirm the requirements. In the
call, we make sure BYOC can address them, and we check your environment
eligibility for the feature.

:::important
Before getting down to enabling BYOC, check the availability of the
feature in
[Who is eligible for BYOC](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc#eligible-for-byoc), make sure
you understand all the
[limitations](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/enable-byoc#byoc-enable-limitations),
and meet all the
[prerequisites](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/enable-byoc#byoc-enable-prerequisites).

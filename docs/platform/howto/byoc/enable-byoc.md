Enabling [the bring your own cloud (BYOC) feature](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc) allows you to [create custom clouds](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/create-custom-cloud) in your Aiven organization.

:::note
Enabling [the BYOC feature](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc) or creating custom
clouds in your Aiven environment does not affect the configuration of your
existing Aiven organizations, projects, or services. It only allows you to run Aiven
services in your cloud provider account.
:::

## Required access

You must be a [super admin](/docs/platform/howto/make-super-admin) to enable this feature.

## About enabling BYOC

To be able to create custom clouds on the Aiven platform, first you need
to enable the BYOC feature. [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/)
offers a quick and easy way to set up a short call with the Aiven sales
team to identify your use cases and confirm the requirements. In the
call, we make sure BYOC can address them, and we check your environment
eligibility for the feature.

:::important
Before enabling BYOC, confirm your
[eligibility](/docs/platform/concepts/byoc#eligible-for-byoc) and review the
[limitations](/docs/platform/howto/byoc/enable-byoc#byoc-enable-limitations).

title: Payment methods
---

You can make payments by credit card, bank transfer, or using your AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure [marketplace subscriptions](/docs/platform/howto/list-marketplace-payments).

### Credit card payments

The default payment method for new customers is credit card. All costs accrued
over a calendar month are charged on the first day of the following month.

You can add credit cards as a payment method to your organization and use
them across different [billing groups](/docs/platform/concepts/billing-groups-overview)
to pay for your Aiven services.

### Bank transfers

Aiven offers invoice billing and bank transfer payments for customers
who have at least 1,000 USD in monthly recurring revenue. Invoices are
generated at the end of the month based on actual usage and a PDF is emailed to the
[billing contacts](/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups#update-your-billing-information)
for each billing group.

Prices for Aiven services are always in US dollars, but invoices
can also be sent in the following currencies:

-   Australian dollars
-   Canadian dollars
-   Swiss francs
-   Danish kroner
-   Euros
-   Pounds sterling
-   Japanese yen
-   Norwegian kroner
-   New Zealand dollars
-   Swedish kronor

Invoices in different currencies are created based on the exchange
rates on the date of the invoice. To switch from credit card charges to bank transfers,
contact [billing@aiven.io](mailto:billing@aiven.io) to request invoice billing.

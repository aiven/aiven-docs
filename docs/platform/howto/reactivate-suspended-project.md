title: Reactivate suspended projects
---

If you have bills past due and didn't set up a payment method, you may
receive this error when trying to log in to the console:

```
ERROR

Project suspended, access prohibited
```

## Reactivate a suspended project

To get access to the project again, open a support case by emailing
`support@aiven.io` with the following information:

-   Your full name
-   Name of the project
-   Email address associated with the account

After you regain access, you can
[provide a payment method](/docs/platform/howto/manage-payment-card) to avoid this issue in the future.

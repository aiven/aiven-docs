title: Configure user provisioning for Okta
limited: true
---

You can automate user provisioning with Okta through System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM). This means you can manage your users and their profiles in one place, Okta, and push those changes to the Aiven platform.

Aivenâ€™s integration with Okta supports these features:

- **Push new users**: Users created in Okta are automatically created as managed users
  in Aiven.
- **Push profile updates**: User profile updates in Okta are pushed to Aiven. Profiles
  for these users cannot be changed in Aiven.
- **Push user deactivation**: Users that are deactivated or removed in Okta are
  deactivated in Aiven. You can manually delete users in Aiven after they are deactivated.
- **Push groups**: Groups created or updated in Okta are created and updated in Aiven.

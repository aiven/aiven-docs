title: Solve payment issues when upgrading to larger service plans
---

When you a project has an invalid payment method and no invoices have been paid, you may receive the following error when starting a new service or upgrade the plan of an existing one:

```text
Creating a plan this large requires valid payment information and
at least one invoice having been paid.

Please contact support to enable creation of larger plans
when these conditions are not met.
```

To upgrade to larger plans, contact the [sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io).

Alternatively, when creating a service or upgrading the plan you may
also see:

```text
Payment method is not set and there is not enough credits for the
service.
```

This indicates that no valid credit card or other payment method has
been assigned to the project yet, and there are not enough credits
remaining to start the requested service plan. Add a billing method to
your project to continue.

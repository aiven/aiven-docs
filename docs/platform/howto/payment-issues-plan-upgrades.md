title: Solve payment issues when upgrading to larger service plans
---

When you have set up a project without a valid credit card or other
payment method and no invoices have been paid, you may receive the
following error when you try to spin up a new service or upgrade the
plan of an existing one:

```text
Creating plan this large requires valid payment information and at least one invoice having been paid.

Please contact support to enable creation of larger plans when these conditions are not met.
```

In order to gain access to higher plans, please contact our support team
at [support@aiven.io](mailto:support@aiven.io) and we will help you get going with your new plan.

Alternatively, when creating a service or upgrading the plan you may
also see:

:::warning
Payment method is not set and there is not enough credits for the
service.
:::

This indicates that no valid credit card or other payment method has
been assigned to the project yet, and there are not enough credits
remaining to start the requested service plan. Add a billing method to
your project to continue.

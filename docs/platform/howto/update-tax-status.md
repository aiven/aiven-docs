title: Update your tax status
---

You can add your VAT ID in the billing information in the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io).

:::info
You must be a [super admin](/docs/platform/howto/make-super-admin) to access this feature.
:::

1.  Click **Billing**.
2.  Click **Billing groups**.
3.  Select the billing group to update.
4.  Click **Billing information**.
5.  In the **Billing details** section, click **Edit**.
6.  Enter your **VAT ID** and click **Save**.

You can change also the billing address by clicking **Edit** in the
**Company details** section. Once the billing country has been updated,
it will be used in all future invoices. Billing estimates are updated
approximately once an hour, so it may take up to an hour for the new tax
status to become visible on the invoice estimates.

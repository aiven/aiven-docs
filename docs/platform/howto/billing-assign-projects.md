title: Assign projects to billing groups
---

You can assign multiple projects to a billing group to [use the same payment card and consolidate the costs](/docs/platform/concepts/billing-groups-overview).

Each project can only be assigned to one billing group. If a project is already assigned
to a billing group and you assign it to another, it's removed from the first group.

You must be an [organization admin](/docs/platform/concepts/permissions#organization-roles-and-permissions) to access this feature.

To assign projects to a billing group:

1.  Go to **Billing** > **Billing groups**.
1.  Select the billing group to assign the project to.
1.  On the **Projects** tab, click **Assign projects**.
1.  Select the projects and click **Assign projects**.
1.  Click **Cancel** to close the dialog box.

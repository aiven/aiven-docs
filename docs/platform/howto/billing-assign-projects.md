title: Assign projects to billing groups
---

You can assign multiple projects to a billing group to [use the same payment card and consolidate the costs](/docs/platform/concepts/billing-groups).

Each project can only be assigned to one billing group. If a project is already assigned
to a billing group and you assign it to another, it will be removed from the first group.

To assign projects to a billing group:

1.  Go to **Billing** > **Billing groups**.
1.  Select the billing group you want to assign the project to.
1.  On the **Projects** tab, click **Assign projects**.
1.  Select the projects and click **Assign projects**.
1.  Click **Cancel** to close the dialog box.

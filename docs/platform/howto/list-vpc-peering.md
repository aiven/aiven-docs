The VPC peering capability supported on the Aiven Platform improves network connectivity and security. It simplifies architecture, helps reduce network latency, and enhances resource sharing while maintaining isolation and control.

[VPC](/docs/platform/concepts/vpcs) peering is a networking connection between two VPCs.
It allows private and direct communication between the VPCs with no traffic routing over
the public internet.

### VPC peering characteristics

- Private communication:  Uses private IP addresses for direct communication between VPCs
- High performance: Low latency thanks to traffic remaining on the cloud provider's network
- Security: Reduces exposure to public networks without using internet gateways, VPNs, or
  NAT
- Scalability: Supports connections across different accounts and regions, depending on a
  cloud provider

### VPC peering use cases

- Multi-tier applications: Secure connnection between VPCs hosting different application
  layers, such as web or database
- Resource sharing: Secure sharing between VPCs hosting different resources,
  for example, datasets or APIs
- Data isolation: Enforce access control by using separate VPCs for different projects or
  teams in an organization

## How it works

Aiven allows you to set up peering connections for
[project VPCs](/docs/platform/concepts/vpcs#project-vpcs)
and for [organization VPCs](/docs/platform/concepts/vpcs#vpc-types).

Aiven VPCs can be peered with VPCs in the following cloud platforms:

- Google Cloud
- Amazon Web Services
- Microsoft Azure
- UpCloud

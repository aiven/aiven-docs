Create groups of users in your organization to make it easier to manage access to your organization's resources.

You can [grant permissions](/docs/platform/howto/manage-permissions) to groups
for projects, giving them the right level of access to the project and its services.

## Create a group

To create a group in an organization:

1.  Click **Admin** > **Groups**.
1.  Click **Create group**.
1.  Enter a unique name for the group. You can also enter a description.
1.  Optional: To assign users to the group, click the toggle and choose
    the users to add.
1.  Click **Create group**.

## Add users to a group

You can only add users that are
[part of your organization](/docs/platform/howto/manage-org-users) to your groups.

To add users to a group:

1.  Click **Admin** > **Groups**.
1.  Select the group to add users to.
1.  Click **Add users**.
1.  Choose the users to add.
1.  Click **Add users**.

## Rename a group

1.  Click **Admin** > **Groups**.
1.  Find the group to rename and
    click <ConsoleLabel name="actions"/> > **Rename**.

## Remove a group

When you remove a group, the users in that group will lose access to any
projects the group has permissions for unless they are part of another
group with that access.

1.  Click **Admin** > **Groups**.
1.  Find the group to remove and
    click <ConsoleLabel name="actions"/> > **Remove** and confirm.

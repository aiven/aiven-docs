title: Use Prometheus with Aiven
---

Discover Prometheus as a tool for monitoring your Aiven services. Check why use it and how it works. Learn how to enable and configure Prometheus on your project.

## About Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It
implements an in-memory and persistent storage model for metrics as well
as a query language for accessing the metrics.

The metrics delivery model of Prometheus is a pull model where the
Prometheus server connects to HTTP servers running on the nodes being
monitored and pulls the metrics from them. While this makes the service
discovery more of a challenge than using the more common push approach,
it does have the benefit of making the metrics available not just for
Prometheus but for any application that can read the Prometheus format
from the HTTP server running on Aiven nodes.

## Check Prometheus support for your service

Usually one Prometheus integration endpoint can be used for all services
in the same project. To check if Prometheus is supported on your
service, verify if the project for this service has a
Prometheus integration endpoint created:

1. Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), go to
   **Projects** in the top navigation bar, and select your project from
   the dropdown list.
1. On the **Services** page, select **Integration endpoints** from the
   left sidebar.
1. On the **Integration endpoints** page, select **Prometheus** from
   the list available integration endpoints, and check if there is any
   endpoint available under **Endpoint Name**.

If there is a Prometheus endpoint available, your service supports
Prometheus. If there's no Prometheus endpoint available, proceed to
[Enable Prometheus on your Aiven project](/docs/platform/howto/integrations/prometheus-metrics#enable-prometheus) to set up Prometheus for your service (project).

## Enable Prometheus

Aiven offers Prometheus endpoints for your services. To enable this
feature:

1. Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), go to
   **Projects** in the top navigation bar, and select your project from
   the dropdown list.

1. On the **Services** page, select **Integration endpoints** from the
   left sidebar.

1. On the **Integration endpoints** page, select **Prometheus** from
   the list available integration endpoints, and select **Add new
   endpoint**.

1. In the **Create new Prometheus endpoint** window, enter the details
   for the endpoint, and select **Create**.

1. Select **Services** from the sidebar, and navigate to the service
   that you would like to monitor.

1. On the **Overview** page of your service, go to the **Service
   integrations** section, and select **Manage integrations**.

1. On the **Integrations** page, select **Prometheus**.

1. In the **Prometheus integration** window, select the endpoint name
   you created from the dropdown list, and select **Enable**.

   :::note
   At the top of the **Integrations** page, you will see the Prometheus
   integration listed and status `active`.
   :::

1. Next, navigate to the service's **Overview** page, and locate
   the **Connection information** section.

1. Click the **Prometheus** tab.

1. Copy **Service URI**, and use it in your browser to access the
   Prometheus dashboard.

The system initiates an HTTP server on all service nodes, granting
access to the metrics. Aiven is exposing endpoints for your services.

:::note
There might be a slight delay of approximately one minute before the
metrics become available.

### Accessing Prometheus in a VPC

If you use a VPC in your project, follow these steps to access
Prometheus:

1. Access [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
1. Select your project, and select the service you want to monitor
   using Prometheus.
1. Click **Service settings** from the sidebar.
1. In the **Cloud and network** section, click the actions
   (**...**) menu.
1. Choose **More network configurations**.
1. In the **Network configuration** window, select **Add configuration
   options**.
1. Search for the `public_access.prometheus` property and enable it.
1. Click **Save configuration**.

## Configure Prometheus

After enabling Prometheus on your project, add a scrape configuration to
Prometheus for the servers you want to pull data from. The examples in
this section show how to set up the scrape configuration for both
single-node and multi-node services.

### Single-node services

For single-node services, configure the following in your
`scrape_config` job entry in `prometheus.yml`:

-   `basic_auth` details: Check your service's the **Overview** page >
    the **Connection information** section > the **Prometheus** tab).

-   `PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_URI`: Check **Service URI** on your service's
    the **Overview** page > the **Connection information** section >
    the **Prometheus** tab).

-   `ca_file`: Download the CA certificate from your service's the
    **Overview** page, and specify its location (the certificates are
    signed by the Aiven project CA).

    :::note
    You can download the CA certificate using the [Aiven command line
    client](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client/) and command
    `avn project ca-get --target-filepath ca.pem`.
    :::

:::note[Sample configuration]

```bash
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: aivenmetrics
    scheme: https
    basic_auth:
      username: <PROMETHEUS_USERNAME>
      password: <PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD>
    tls_config:
      ca_file: ca.pem
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["<PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_URI>:<PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_PORT"]
```

:::

With the configuration in place, Prometheus starts pulling metrics from
your service.

### Multi-node services

1. For any service that consist of multiple nodes without a DNS name
    for each node, use the `dns_sd_configs` option to define the servers
    with DNS type set to `A`.

   Prometheus resolves all the IP addresses associated with the DNS name
   and query all of those IP addresses directly. A side effect of using
   this IP resolution is that Prometheus expects the TLS certificate to be
   bound to the IP addresses of the hosts, not to the DNS name.

1. Enable the `insecure_skip_verify` setting so that Prometheus
   wouldn't verify if the TLS certificate is bound to the IP addresses
   of the hosts.

    ```bash
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: aivenmetrics
        scheme: https
        basic_auth:
          username: <PROMETHEUS_USERNAME>
          password: <PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD>
        dns_sd_configs:
          - names:
              - <PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_URI>
            type: A
            port: <PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_PORT>
        tls_config:
          insecure_skip_verify: true
    ```

   :::note
   For Aiven services with multiple nodes and a Replica URI, the primary
   DNS name does not include standby IP addresses. To track those, make
   sure to include the replica DNS names in the list. If you have
   `<PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_URI>` as `public-example.aivencloud.com`, then you
   will need to add `public-replica-example.aivencloud.com`. This applies
   to PostgreSQL®, MySQL®, Apache Kafka®, and Redis®\* services.
   :::

### View full list of metrics

The Prometheus client, provided through the Telegraf plugin, offers access to a
comprehensive range of metrics, similar to those previously available through another
metrics integration, now accessible via the Prometheus integration.

You can preview the full list of metrics in
[Prometheus system metrics](/docs/integrations/prometheus-system-metrics).

:::note
For some services the metrics provided by different hosts may vary
depending on the host role. Most notably for Kafka® only one of the
nodes provides metrics related to consumer group offsets.

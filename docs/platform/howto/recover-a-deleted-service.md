title: Recover a deleted service
---

For active or suspended services, the related backups can be directly restored by the user through [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) or CLI through a couple of clicks of the mouse or a command line invocation.

However, once a service is deleted then the backups will no longer be
visible or restorable by the user. Several safeguards are in place to
avoid accidental deletion of a service, but it can still happen, for example
through human error or a malicious user that has gained administrative
access credentials.

To address this concern we store the backups and encryption keys for all
deleted services for **30 days**. Therefore, as a disaster recovery
option, the backups can be restored by contacting [support@aiven.io](mailto:support@aiven.io).

:::note
As this is a manual operation from our operations team and intended for
disaster recovery only, the recovery of a deleted service may incur an
additional cost to your project.

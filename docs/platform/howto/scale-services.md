Adjust the plan of your services at any time to scale your services as needed and optimize costs.
You can also [adjust disk storage][storage] without changing your plan.

:::important

- Downgrading to a plan with fewer VMs is not supported.
- Changing a service plan triggers a node recycle, service rebuilding, and any pending
  maintenance updates.

<TabItem value="terraform" label="Terraform">

Update the `plan` attribute in
[your Aiven service resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

To change a service plan in the Aiven CLI, use the
[`avn service update --plan <plan>`](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn-cli-service-update)
command.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your service's state becomes **Rebuilding** and remains accessible. When the
state switches to **Running**, your new service plan is active.

:::note
When you perform a service upgrade or downgrade horizontally, include all additional disks
the service uses. For example, when switching from `Startup-4` to `Business-4` or from
`Business-4` to `Startup-4`, include all the additional disks available for this service.

title: Set up VPC peering on UpCloud
---

Network peerings enable traffic between two networks from different accounts or platforms.

A peering needs to be established from both connecting components to be activated.

## About establishing Aiven-Upcloud peering

Peering Aiven and UpCloud networks requires establishing the connection
on both ends: Aiven and UpCloud.

-   To set up a peering from Aiven to UpCloud, you can use [Aiven
    Console](https://console.aiven.io/) to create a VPC for your Aiven
    project and add a peering connection to UpCloud. For this purpose,
    identify the UpCloud SDN network UUID first.
-   To set up a peering from UpCloud to Aiven, you can use [UpCloud
    API](https://developers.upcloud.com/1.3/). Since the API takes UUIDs
    of both networks as attributes, identify the network
    UUIDs before calling the API.

## Limitations

-   Peering connections are only supported between networks of type
    `private`.
-   You cannot initiate a peering between two networks with overlapping
    CIDR ranges.
-   The networks to be peered need to be in the same cloud zone.

:::important
Make sure you only create peerings between accounts, platforms, or
networks you trust. There is no limit on what traffic can flow between
the peered components. The server firewall has no effect on `private`
type networks.
:::

## Prerequisites

-   You have
    [created a VPC for your Aiven project](manage-vpc-peering) in [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
-   CIDR ranges of the networks you want to peer do not overlap.

## Get UpCloud SDN network UUID {#upcloud-uuid}

Before establishing a peering connection from Aiven to UpCloud, you need
to find your UpCloud SDN network UUID.

To check the UpCloud SDN network UUID, send a request to [get network
details](https://developers.upcloud.com/1.3/13-networks/#get-network-details)
UpCloud API endpoint. In the response, you'll get the network's UUID.

## Set up VPC peering from Aiven {#avn-uuid}

You can establish a peering connection from Aiven to UpCloud using
[Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), navigate to
    the organization and project you want to use.
1.  On the **Services** page, select **VPCs** from the sidebar.
1.  On the **Virtual private clouds** page, select the ID of the VPC
    connection you want to use for the peering.
1.  On the **VPC peering connections** page, in the **Add peering
    connection** section, populate **Peer network ID** field with your
    UpCloud SDN network UUIDs.
1.  Select **Add peering connection**. This adds a new connection to the
    VPC peering connections list.
1.  Wait until you see the `peer_pending` state in the **State** column
    of the of the VPC peering connections table. At this point, the
    Aiven VPC network UUID should be available in the **Aiven network
    ID** column of the of the VPC peering connections table.

## Set up VPC peering from UpCloud

To establish a VPC peering from UpCloud to Aiven, use [UpCloud
API](https://developers.upcloud.com/1.3/) to send the following request:

```bash
POST /1.3/network-peering HTTP/1.1
{
  "network_peering": {
    "configured_status": "active",
    "name": "NAME_OF_YOUR_PEERING",
    "network": {
      "uuid": "UPCLOUD_SDN_NETWORK_UUID"
    },
    "peer_network": {
      "uuid": "AIVEN_VPC_NETWORK_UUID"
    }
  }
}
```

### Expected response

:::note
The sample response provided describes a peering established one way
only.
:::

If your peering API request is successful, you can expect a response
similar to the following:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
{
  "network_peering": {
    "configured_status": "active",
    "name": "NAME_OF_YOUR_PEERING",
    "network": {
      "ip_networks": {
        "ip_network": [
          {
            "address": "192.168.0.0/24",
            "family": "IPv4"
          },
          {
            "address": "fc02:c4f3::/64",
            "family": "IPv6"
          }
        ]
      },
      "uuid": "UPCLOUD_SDN_NETWORK_UUID"

```

### Error responses

| HTTP status   | Error code              | Description                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 409 Conflict  | LOCAL_NETWORK_NO_ROUTER | The local network has no router. |
| 404 Not found | NETWORK_NOT_FOUND       | The local network was not found. |

## Renew a DHCP lease

You only need to take this step if any of your VMs has been created
before setting up the network peering. In this case, refresh
the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) lease for a relevant
network interface to get new routes.

:::warning
A peering connection between an Aiven VPC and VMs created before the
peering setup won't work unless you refresh the DHCP lease for a
relevant network interface.
:::

To refresh the DHCP lease for a network interface, run the following
commands:

1.  To clear the existing DHCP lease

    ```bash
    dhclient -r NETWORK_INTERFACE_NAME
    ```

1.  To request a renewal of the DHCP lease

    ```bash
    dhclient NETWORK_INTERFACE_NAME
    ```

import Services from "@site/static/images/icons/database.svg";
import Filter from "@site/static/images/icons/settings.svg";
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

On the <Services className="icon"/> **Services** page in [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), you can search for services by keywords and narrow down the results using filters.

## Search by keyword

When you search by keyword, [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/)
shows all services that have the matching words in the service name,
plan, cloud provider, and tags.

## Filter search results with the UI

To filter search results:

1. Click <Filter className="icon"/> **Filter list**.
1. Select the filters of your choice.

## Filter with a query

You can type filter queries. The supported filters are the following:

-   `service`
-   `status`
-   `provider`
-   `region`

Use several filters by separating them by a comma.
You can use these filters alongside keyword searches.

```text title="All running PostgreSQL® services that are hosted on AWS or Google Cloud"
service:pg status:running provider:aws,google
```

```text title="All powered off Kafka® services with 'production' in the name"

```

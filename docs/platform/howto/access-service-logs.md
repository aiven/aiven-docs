title: Access service logs
---

Occasionally, there is the need to inspect logs from Aiven services. For
example, to debug query performance or inspecting errors caused by a
specific workload.

There are three built-in ways to inspect service logs at Aiven:

-   For recent events, go to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/)  > your service's page > **Logs** view (available from the
    sidebar)

    :::tip
    Logs can be browsed back in time, but scrolling up several thousand
    lines is not very convenient.
    :::

-   For downloading logs programmatically with the
    [dedicated command](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn-service-logs), use [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli) supports

-   For fetching the same information two above methods output, if the
    programmatic access is needed, use the [ProjectGetServiceLogs
    API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#operation/ProjectGetServiceLogs)
    endpoint.

## Log retention policy

Service logs are generally retained for a few days, and for some Aiven
services up to 14 days maximum. Unless you are using
[logs integration](/docs/integrations) to
another service, older logs are not accessible.

If longer retention time or more comprehensive analytics or search
functionality is needed, you can setup a
[log integration with an Aiven for OpenSearch速 service](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/opensearch-log-integration). The integration allows you to configure longer retention
times for your service logs, only limited by the disk space available on
the Aiven for OpenSearch速 plan you have selected. OpenSearch速 together
with OpenSearch速 Dashboards offers comprehensive logs browsing and
analytics platform.

## Create a service in a VPC

You can create a service either in a project VPC or in an organization VPC.

<Tabs groupId="group1">
<TabItem value="pj" label="Project VPC" default>

Your project VPC is available as a geolocation (cloud region) for the new service.

:::note
You can create a service in a project VPC only if it is in the same project
where you are creating the service.
:::

Create a service in a project VPC using a tool of your choice:

<Tabs groupId="group1">
<TabItem value="console" label="Aiven Console" default>

Set your project VPC as a cloud region for the new service:

<CreateService />

</TabItem>

Run [avn service create](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn-cli-service-create):

```bash
avn service create SERVICE_NAME        \
  --project PROJECT_NAME               \
  --project-vpc-id PROJECT_VPC_ID      \
  --service-type SERVICE_TYPE          \
  --plan SERVICE_PLAN                  \
  --cloud CLOUD_PROVIDER_REGION
```

Replace the following:

- `SERVICE_NAME` with the name of the service to be created, for example,
  `pg-vpc-test`
- `PROJECT_NAME` with the name of the project where to create the service, for example,
  `pj-test`
- `PROJECT_VPC_ID` with the ID of your project VPC, for example,
  `12345678-1a2b-3c4d-5f6g-1a2b3c4d5e6f`

## Migrate a service deployed in a VPC to another cloud

Aiven doesn't natively support automatic migration of a service from a VPC in one cloud
provider to another. The migration is possible manually by following these generic
instructions, which may need to be adapted to meet specific security or compliance
requirements:

1. [Create a new service in the destination cloud/VPC](/docs/platform/howto/vpc-service-management#create-a-service-in-a-vpc).
1. Set up replication or export/import, depending on the service:
   1. Aiven for PostgreSQL®, Aiven for MySQL® or similar: Use `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`,
      logical replication, or Aiven’s replication features.
   1. Aiven for Apache Kafka®: Use
      [Aiven for Apache Kafka® MirrorMaker 2](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-mirrormaker) or
      Confluent Replicator.
1. Sync data and test the new setup.
1. Cut over traffic to the new service.
1. Decommission the old service.

:::note
Reach out to your account team if you need more migration guidance or best practices.
:::

## Access a service deployed in a VPC from the public internet

When you move your service to a VPC, access from public networks is
blocked by default. If you switch to public access, a separate endpoint
is created with a public prefix. You can enable public internet access
for your services by following the
[Enable public access in a VPC](/docs/platform/howto/public-access-in-vpc) instructions.

IP filtering is available for a service deployed to a VPC. It's recommended to
[use IP filtering](/docs/platform/howto/restrict-access#restrict-access) when your VPC
service is also exposed to the public internet.

:::note
If your service is within a VPC, the VPC configuration filters incoming traffic before the
IP filter is applied.
:::

Safelisting applies to both internal and external traffic. If you
safelist an external IP address and want to keep traffic flowing with
the internal (peered) connections, safelist the CIDR blocks of the peered networks as well
to avoid disruptions to the service.

## Overview

Aiven manages a number of [services](/docs/products/services). These services share
similar good practices when it comes to managing them.

Understand the fundamentals:

- [Service resources](/docs/platform/concepts/service-resources)
- [Service memory limits](/docs/platform/concepts/service-memory-limits)
- [Service backups](/docs/platform/concepts/service_backups)
- [Service maintenance](/docs/platform/concepts/maintenance-window)

Create and configure your service:

1. [Create your service](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service).
1. [Add users](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service_user).
1. See the docs for your [specific service](/docs/products/services).

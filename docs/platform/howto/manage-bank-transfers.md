Aiven offers invoice billing and bank transfer payments for customers who have at least 1,000 USD in monthly recurring revenue.

Invoices are generated at the end of the month based on actual usage
and a PDF is emailed to the
[billing contacts](/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups#update-your-billing-information)
for each billing group.

Prices for Aiven services are always in US dollars, but invoices
can also be sent in the following currencies:

-   Australian dollars
-   Canadian dollars
-   Swiss francs
-   Danish kroner
-   Euros
-   Pounds sterling
-   Japanese yen
-   Norwegian kroner
-   New Zealand dollars
-   Swedish kronor

Invoices in different currencies are created based on the exchange
rates on the date of the invoice.

To switch from credit card charges to bank transfers,
contact [billing@aiven.io](mailto:billing@aiven.io) to request invoice billing.

title: Enable public access in VPCs
---

To enable public access for a service which is running within a virtual
private cloud (VPC), follow these steps:

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io) and select your
    service from the **Services** page.

2.  On the **Overview** page of your service, select **Service
    settings** from the sidebar.

3.  On the **Service settings** page, navigate to the **Cloud and
    network** section and select **More network configurations** from
    the actions (**...**) menu.

4.  In the **Network configuration** window, select **Add configuration
    options**. In the search field, enter `public_access`. From the
    displayed parameter names, select a parameter name for your service
    type. Select the toggle switch to enable the selected parameter.
    Select **Save configuration**.

    The **Overview** page now has an **Access Route** setting inside the
    **Connection information** section with **Public** and **Dynamic**
    options.

5.  Select **Public** to see the public URL for your service.

The connection with the **Dynamic** option is not possible outside the
VPC, while the connection with the **Public** option is accessible over
the public Internet. **IP Allow-List** applies to all connection types
(Dynamic and Public, in this example).

:::note
You can change the `public_access` settings without any service
downtime.

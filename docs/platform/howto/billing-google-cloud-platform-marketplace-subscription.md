:::note

- The URL to log into your GCP subscription is [console.gcp.aiven.io](https://console.gcp.aiven.io).
  Do not confuse it with Aiven Console URL: [console.aiven.io](https://console.aiven.io).

- If you have an existing Aiven account, create a new Aiven GCP account using the
  Aiven GCP console. When coming back to Aiven in the future, use
  [https://console.gcp.aiven.io](https://console.gcp.aiven.io) to log in.

- When you view the Aiven page on GCP Marketplace,
  a new **MANAGE ON PROVIDER** is available. It takes
  you to the Aiven GCP Console at [https://console.gcp.aiven.io](https://console.gcp.aiven.io).

## Billing

Services you deploy through your subscription are billed per hour and
metering is sent from Aiven to Google. You can view this in the
**Billing** section in Google Cloud.

The subscription is shown as **Use of Aiven** and the following labels
show your usage per service:

-   `container_name`: The name of the Aiven project
-   `resource_name`: The name of Aiven service

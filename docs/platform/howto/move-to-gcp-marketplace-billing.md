title: Move from Aiven direct billing to Google Cloud Platform Marketplace
---

Aiven makes its services available through the Google Cloud Platform Marketplace. If you already have some services running in a project, which is billed directly through Aiven, you can move to a Google Cloud Platform Marketplace subscription without disrupting your services.

1. [Set up Google Cloud Platform Marketplace for Aiven Services](/docs/marketplace-setup).
   The new Aiven organization will contain your projects.

1. Collect the required information:

   1. From your **existing Aiven account**, retrieve The name of the Aiven projects
      that contain the services you wish to move.

   1. From your **new Aiven organization** with the GCP marketplace
      subscription, retrieve the Aiven organization name, as shown in the
      [Aiven GCP console](https://console.gcp.aiven.io/).

1. Send the information by email to [the sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io).

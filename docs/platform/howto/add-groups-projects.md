import ConsoleLabel from "@site/src/components/ConsoleIcons"

Give [groups](/docs/platform/howto/manage-groups) of organization users access to a project and the services
in it by adding groups to it. When you add a group, you set the
permission level by assigning the group a
[role](/docs/platform/reference/project-member-privileges) for that specific project.

## Add groups to a project

1.  In the project, click <ConsoleLabel name="members"/>.
2.  Click **Add groups**.
3.  Select the groups to add to the project.
4.  Select a **Role**. This
    [role](/docs/platform/reference/project-member-privileges) will be assigned to all users in all selected groups.
5.  Click **Add groups**.

You can change a group's role or remove it from a project later from
the <ConsoleLabel name="actions"/> for that group.

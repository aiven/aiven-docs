Give [groups](/docs/platform/howto/manage-groups) of organization users access to a project and the services in it by adding groups to it. When you add a group, you grant permissions to all users in the group by assigning the group [roles and permissions](/docs/platform/concepts/permissions) for that specific project.

## Add groups to a project

1.  In the project, click <ConsoleLabel name="members"/>.
1.  Click **Add groups**.
1.  Select the groups to add to the project.
1.  Select the **Roles** to assign to all users in the selected groups.
1.  Click **Add groups**.

You can change a group's roles or remove it from a project later from
the <ConsoleLabel name="actions"/> for that group.

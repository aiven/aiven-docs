title: Create a new service
---

Follow these steps to create a new service in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/). You can also
[create a service using the Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn-cli-service-create).

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
2.  Using the top navigation bar, go to the organization and the project
    that you want to create a service in.
3.  On the project's page, make sure your in the **Services** view and
    select **Create service**.
4.  From the **Select service** page, select the service that you want
    to create.
5.  On the **Create service** page
    1.  Select the cloud provider and region that you want to run your
        service on.

        :::note
        The pricing for the same service may vary between different
        providers and regions. The service summary shows you the pricing
        for your selected options.
        :::

    2.  Select a service plan.

        :::note
        This determines the number of servers and what kind of memory,
        CPU, and disk resources are allocated to your service. Check out
        [Plans & Pricing](https://aiven.io/pricing?product=pg) for
        details.
        :::

    3.  Add
        [disk storage](/docs/platform/concepts/dynamic-disk-sizing) for your service by using the slider, if needed. The
        cost for the additional storage is in the service summary
        section.

        :::note
        It's not possible to add storage space for all cloud
        environments and service plans.
        :::

    4.  Enter a name for your service.

    5.  Select **Create service** from the right-side **Service
        Summary** card.

The new service opens on the **Overview** page, where you can find the
connection parameters for your service, its current status, and the
configuration options.

:::note
The service is in the **Rebuilding** status while it is being created.
Once the service is ready, the status changes to **Running**. While
services typically start up in a couple of minutes, the performance
varies between cloud providers and regions, and it may take longer.

title: Change unsafe passwords
---

The Aiven Platform checks your email and password combination against a database of exposed credentials every time you log in and change your password.

If Aiven detects an unsafe password,  your login is blocked until you
[reset your password](/docs/platform/reference/change-password#reset-your-password) to
keep your account safe.

You don't need to do anything else, but Aiven recommends every user
[enable two-factor authentication](/docs/platform/howto/user-2fa).
Two-factor authentication also needs to be re-enabled after you
reset or change your password.

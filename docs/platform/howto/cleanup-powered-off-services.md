title: Periodic cleanup of powered-off services
---

The Aiven platform provides a way to power-off services to stop
accumulating usage costs when not in use. However, leaving them
powered-off for an extended period of time comes with disadvantages.

The Aiven platform receive regular maintenance updates to keep the
services updated with the latest supported versions upstream, including
fixes to bugs, security vulnerabilities, and overall improvements to
performance and memory consumption.

Keeping services in powered-off state for a long time lowers the
feasibility of a smooth upgrade path, making it harder for Aiven to
continue supporting your needs.

:::note

-   It is recommended that you regularly review your services and delete
    those that are no longer needed. This allows Aiven to focus on
    supporting the services that you actively use and better utilize
    platform resources.
-   If a service has been powered off for 90 days, you will receive
    email notifications reminding you that the service has been inactive
    for a prolonged period. If the service remains powered off for 180
    consecutive days, it is subject to automatic deletion.

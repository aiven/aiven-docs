Cloud services can be created, paused, or destroyed as needed, to optimize costs. For example, you can power the service off temporarily to save credits.

import StaticIp from "@site/static/includes/static-ip-cost-warning.md";

<StaticIp/>

You can update the state of your service either through the service
overview page in [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io) or by using
Aiven command line interface:

```bash
avn service update <your service name> --power-off
```

When you're ready to continue using the service run the command to
power it on. Use the `wait` command to see when the service is up and
running.

```bash
avn service update <your service name> --power-on
avn service wait <your service name>
```

If you have finished exploring your OpenSearchÂ® service, you can destroy
or _terminate_ the service. To terminate the service completely use
the following command:

```bash
avn service terminate <your service name>
```

You will be prompted to re-enter the service name to confirm that you
want to complete the termination.

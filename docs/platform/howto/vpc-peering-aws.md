[VPC on the Aiven platform](/docs/platform/howto/manage-vpc-peering).

## Set up VPC peering

1.  Open your AWS Console.

1.  Go to **My Account** and make note of your account ID.

1.  Go to the VPC service to find the VPC to connect and copy its ID.

1.  In [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), select **VPCs** from
    the sidebar on the **Services** page.

1.  On the **Virtual private clouds** page, select the VPC connection
    that you created.

1.  On the **VPC Peering connections** page, enter your AWS account ID
    and VPC ID, select the region for your AWS VPC, and select **Add
    peering connection**.

    :::note
    A new connection with the **Pending Acceptance** status
    is added in your AWS Console.
    :::

1.  In your AWS Console, ensure the account ID and VPC ID match
    those listed in the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) and,
    if so, click <ConsoleLabel name="actions"/> > **Accept Request**.

1.  Update [your AWS route
    tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-routing.html)
    to match your Aiven CIDR settings.

When you accept the request in AWS Console, the peering connection gets
activated in the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

Services you deploy through your subscription are billed per hour and
metering is sent from Aiven to Google. You can view this in the
**Billing** section in Google Cloud.

The subscription is shown as **Use of Aiven** and the following labels
show your usage per service:

-   `container_name`: The name of the Aiven project

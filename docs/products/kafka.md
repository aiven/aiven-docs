## What is Aiven for Apache Kafka®?

Aiven for Apache Kafka® is a fully managed **distributed data streaming
platform**, deployable in the cloud of your choice. Apache Kafka is an
open source data streaming platform, ideal for event-driven
applications, near-real-time data transfer and pipelines, stream
analytics, and many more applications where a lot of data needs to move
between applications in a speedy manner.

Kafka stores a potentially large number of records, each contains a
small amount of data, usually for a limited period of time. The storage
is organised into \"topics\" and \"partitions\" so that many data
streams can be handled at once, regardless of how much data is flowing
into or out of your Aiven for Apache Kafka service.

## Why Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka itself is technically a distributed log storage mechanism;
in reality it is a best-in-class, highly-available data streaming
solution. Oh, and it just happens to have an incredibly rich ecosystem
of open source tooling that connects to and extends the existing
platform.

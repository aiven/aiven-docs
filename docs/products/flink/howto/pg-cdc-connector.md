title: Create a PostgreSQL® CDC connector-based Apache Flink®
---

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique that enables the tracking and
capturing of changes made to data within a PostgreSQL® database. By
identifying and capturing changes at the granular row level, CDC enables
applications to react and promptly process these changes in real time.
This ensures up-to-date data accuracy and minimizes the latency involved
in processing updates.

When using Aiven for Apache Flink®, you can seamlessly leverage the
power of the PostgreSQL CDC Connector to stream and process real-time
data changes from PostgreSQL databases. Integrated with the Debezium
engine, the CDC connector captures changes at the granular level of each
table within an event stream.

This article provides you with information on how to create a PostgreSQL
CDC connector-based Apache Flink® table.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the PostgreSQL CDC Connector with Aiven for Apache
Flink, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

-   Running Aiven for Apache Flink® Service
-   Running Aiven for PostgreSQL® Service
-   Running Aiven for Apache Kafka® Service or any other service of your
    choice as the sink for your data.
-   [Integration](/docs/products/flink/howto/create-integration) between Aiven for Flink and Aiven for PostgreSQL:
    Establish the necessary integration between your Aiven for Apache
    Flink service and Aiven for PostgreSQL service.

In addition to the above, gather the following information about the
source PostgreSQL database:

-   `Hostname`: The hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server
    where your source database is located.
-   `Port`: The port number on which the PostgreSQL server is listening
    for incoming connections.
-   `Database name`: The name of the source database within the
    PostgreSQL server.
-   `Username`: The username used to authenticate and access the
    PostgreSQL database.
-   `Password`: The password associated with the provided username for
    authentication.
-   `Schema name`: The schema name where the source table is located
    within the database.
-   `Table name`: The name of the source table from which you want to
    capture data changes.
-   `Decoding plugin name`: The decoding plugin name to use for
    capturing the changes. For PostgreSQL CDC, set it as `pgoutput`.

:::important
To create a PostgreSQL CDC source connector in Aiven for Apache Flink
with Aiven for PostgreSQL using the pgoutput plugin, you need to have
superuser privileges.

## Configure the PostgreSQL CDC connector

Follow these steps to configure the PostgreSQL CDC Connector in the
Aiven for Flink application table using the [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/):

1.  In the Aiven for Apache Flink service page, select **Application**
    from the left sidebar.

2.  Select **Create new application**, enter the name of your
    application, and select **Create application**.

    :::note
    If editing an existing application, create a version to make
    changes to the source or sink tables.
    :::

3.  Select **Create first version** to create the first version of the
    application.

4.  Select **Add your first source table** to add a source table.

5.  In the **Add new source table** screen, select the *Aiven for
    PostgreSQL®* service as the integrated service.

6.  In the **Table SQL** section, enter the SQL statement to create the
    PostgreSQL-based Apache Flink table with CDC connector.

    For example:

    ```
    CREATE TABLE test_table (
        column1 INT,
        column2 VARCHAR
        ) WITH (
        'connector' = 'postgres-cdc',
        'hostname' = 'test-project-test.avns.net',
        'username' = 'username',
        'password' = '12345',
        'schema-name' = 'public',
        'table-name' = 'test-1',
        'port' = '12709',
        'database-name' = 'defaultdb',
        'decoding.plugin.name' = 'pgoutput'
        )
    ```

    Where:

    -   `connector`: The connector type to be used, which is
        `postgres-cdc` in this case.
    -   `hostname`: The hostname or address of the PostgreSQL database
        server.
    -   `username`: The username to authenticate with the PostgreSQL
        database.
    -   `password`: The password for the provided username.
    -   `schema-name`: The name of the schema where the source table is
        located, which is set to `public` in the example.
    -   `table-name`: The name of the source table to be captured by the
        CDC connector, which is set to `test-1` in the example.
    -   `port`: The port number of the PostgreSQL database server.
    -   `database-name`: The name of the database where the source table
        resides, which is set to `defaultdb` in the example.
    -   `decoding.plugin.name`: The decoding plugin to be used by the
        CDC connector, which is set to `pgoutput` in the example.

    :::note
    The PostgreSQL CDC connector will use or create a publication named
    `dbz_publication` tracking the changes of one or more tables.
    Therefore, the publication must already exist in PostgreSQL, or the
    connecting user must have enough privileges to create it.
    :::

7.  Select **Next** to add the sink table, and then select **Add your
    first sink table**. Select *Aiven for Apache Kafka®* as the
    integrated service from the drop-down list.

8.  In the **Table SQL** section, input the SQL statement for creating
    the sink table where the PostgreSQL CDC connector will send the
    data. Select **Add table**.

9.  In the **Create statement** section, write the SQL schema that
    defines the fields retrieved from the PostgreSQL® table and any
    additional transformations.

10. Select **Create deployment** to deploy the application, and in the
    **Create new deployment** screen, choose the desired version to
    deploy (default: Version 1) and select **Deploy without a
    savepoint** (as there are no savepoints available for the first
    application).

## Troubleshooting {#Troubleshooting}

If you encounter the
`must be superuser to create FOR ALL TABLES publication` error when
setting up a PostgreSQL CDC source connector in Aiven for PostgreSQL
using the `pgoutput` plugin, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1.  Install the `aiven-extras` extension by executing the SQL command:

    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION aiven_extras CASCADE;
    ```

2.  Create a publication for all tables in the source database: Execute
    the SQL command:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM aiven_extras.pg_create_publication_for_all_tables(
       'dbz_publication',
       'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE'
      );
    ```

:::note
The publication name must be `dbz_publication` for the PostgreSQL CDC
connector to work

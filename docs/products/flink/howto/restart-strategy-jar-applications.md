title: Restart strategy in JAR applications
---

A restart strategy is a set of rules that Apache Flink® adheres to when
dealing with Flink job failures. These strategies enable the automatic
restart of a failed Flink job under specific conditions and parameters,
which is crucial for high availability and fault tolerance in
distributed and scalable systems.

## Default restart strategy for JAR applications

Aiven for Apache Flink® includes a default restart strategy for JAR
applications. This strategy uses the **exponential-delay** technique,
incrementally increasing the delay time between restarts up to a
specified maximum. Once this maximum delay is reached, it remains
constant for any subsequent restarts. The default strategy is fully
integrated into the Aiven for Apache Flink cluster configuration and
automatically applies to all JAR applications.

### View the default strategy

You can view the default restart strategy configurations for your Aiven
for Apache Flink cluster in the Apache Flink Dashboard. Follow these
steps to view the current settings:

1.  Access the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) and select the
    Aiven for Apache Flink service.
2.  From the **Connection information** section on the overview page,
    copy the **Service URI** and paste it into your web browser's
    address bar.
3.  When prompted, log in using the **User** and **Password**
    credentials specified in the **Connection information** section.
4.  Once in the **Apache Flink Dashboard**, click the **Job Manager**
    from the menu.
5.  Switch to the **Configuration** tab.
6.  Review the configurations and parameters related to the restart
    strategy.

## Disable default restart strategy

While Aiven for Apache Flink® typically recommends using the default
restart strategy for JAR applications, there are circumstances,
particularly during testing or debugging, where disabling automatic
restarts might be necessary. You cannot disable the default restart
strategy in Aiven for Apache Flink® through configuration files.
Instead, directly modify the code of your Jar application to achieve
this.

```java
StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
env.setRestartStrategy(RestartStrategies.noRestart());
```

This code sets the restart strategy to \'None\', preventing any restart
attempts in case of failures.

### Key considerations when disabling default restarts

Before choosing to disable the default restart strategy, consider the
following:

-   **Persistent failures**: Disabling restarts means that if a Flink
    Job fails, Flink will not attempt to recover it, leading to
    permanent job failure.
-   **Testing and debugging**: Disabling is beneficial when identifying
    issues in the application code, as it prevents the masking of errors
    through automatic restarts.
-   **External factors**: Jobs can fail due to external factors, such as
    infrastructure changes or maintenance activities. If you disable
    restarts, your Flink jobs will become vulnerable to failures.
-   **Operational risks**: In production environments, it is generally
    advisable to use the default restart strategy to ensure high
    availability and fault tolerance.

title: Create a DataGen-based Apache Flink® table
---

The DataGen source table is a built-in connector of the Apache Flink
system that generates random data periodically, matching the specified
data type of the source table. This section provides you with
information on how to connect DataGen as a source table in an Aiven for
Apache ®Flink application.

## Configure Datagen as source for Flink application

To configure DataGen as the source using the DataGen built-in connector
for Apache Flink, follow these steps:

1.  In the Aiven for Apache Flink service page, select **Application**
    from the left sidebar.
2.  Create an application or select an existing application for your
    desired
    [data service integration](/docs/products/flink/howto/create-integration).

:::note
If you are editing an existing application, you need to create a
version of the application to make changes to the source or sink table.
:::

3.  In the **Create new version** screen, select **Add source tables**.
4.  Select **Add new table** or select **Edit** to edit an
    existing source table.
5.  In the **Table SQL** section of the **Add new source table** or
    **Edit source table** screen, set the connector to **datagen** as
    shown in the example below:

```
CREATE TABLE `gen_me`
(
    `id` INT, `price` DECIMAL(32,2)
)
WITH
(
    `connector` = 'datagen'
)
```

Where:

-   `connector`: The connector parameter is set to `datagen`, a built-in
    connector in Flink that generates random data in memory and is used
    as a source of data in Flink applications.

:::note
For more information on the connector types and the requirements for
each, see the articles on
[Kafka connector types](/docs/products/flink/concepts/kafka-connectors) and
[the requirements for each connector type](/docs/products/flink/concepts/kafka-connector-requirements).
:::

6.  In the **Add sink tables** screen, select the option to add a new
    sink table or edit an existing one.
7.  In the **Create statement** section, write the statement to test
    your SQL queries using random data.

title: Create an OpenSearch®-based Apache Flink® table
---

To build data pipelines, Apache Flink® requires you to map source and
target data structures as [Flink
tables](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/dev/table/sql/create/#create-table)
within an application. You can accomplish this through the [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) or
[Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli/service/flink).

You can define a Flink table over an existing or new Aiven for
OpenSearch® index, to sink streaming data. To define a table over an
OpenSearch® index, specify the index name, column data formats, and the
Flink table name you want to use as a reference when building data
pipelines.

:::warning
-   To use Flink tables an
    [existing integration](create-integration) must be available between the Aiven for Flink® service
    and one or more Aiven for OpenSearch® services.
-   You can use Aiven for OpenSearch® can only as the **target** of a
    data pipeline. You can create Flink applications that write data to
    an OpenSearch® index. However, reading data from an OpenSearch®
    index is currently not possible.

## Create an OpenSearch®-based Apache Flink® table with Aiven Console

To create an Apache Flink table based on an Aiven for OpenSearch® index
via Aiven console:

1.  In the Aiven for Apache Flink service page, select **Application**
    from the left sidebar.

2.  Create an application or select an existing one with Aiven for
    OpenSearch® integration.

    :::note
    If editing an existing application, create a version to make
    changes to the source or sink tables.
    :::

3.  In the **Create new version** screen, select **Add sink tables**.

4.  Select **Add new table** or select **Edit** if you want to edit an
    existing source table.

5.  In the **Add new sink table** or **Edit sink table** screen, select
    the Aiven for OpenSearch® as the integrated service.

6.  In the **Table SQL** section, enter the SQL statement to create the
    OpenSearch-based Apache Flink table.

    -   Define the **Flink table name**, which will represent the Flink
        reference to the topic and will be used during the data pipeline
        definition.

7.  In the **Create statement** section, write the SQL schema that
    defines the fields to be pushed for each message in the OpenSearch
    index.

## Example: Define an Apache Flink® table to OpenSearch®

We want to push the result of an Apache Flink® application to an index
named `metrics` in an Aiven for OpenSearch® service named
`demo-opensearch`. The application result should generate the following
data:

```text
{'hostname': 'sleepy', 'cpu': 'cpu3', 'usage': 93.30629927475789, 'occurred_at': 1637775077782}
{'hostname': 'dopey', 'cpu': 'cpu4', 'usage': 88.39531418706092, 'occurred_at': 1637775078369}
{'hostname': 'happy', 'cpu': 'cpu2', 'usage': 77.90860728236156, 'occurred_at': 1637775078964}
{'hostname': 'dopey', 'cpu': 'cpu4', 'usage': 81.17372993952847, 'occurred_at': 1637775079054}
```

We can define a `metrics_out` Apache Flink® table with:

-   `demo-opensearch` as integration service
-   `metrics` as OpenSearch® index name
-   `metrics_out` as Flink table name
-   the following as SQL schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE metrics_out (
cpu VARCHAR,
hostname VARCHAR,
usage DOUBLE,
occurred_at BIGINT
) WITH (
'connector' = 'elasticsearch-7',
'hosts' = '',
'index' = 'metrics'
)
```

The `hosts` will be substituted with the appropriate address during
runtime.

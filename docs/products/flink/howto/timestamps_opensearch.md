title: Define OpenSearch® timestamp data in SQL pipeline
---

Frequently results in Apache Flink® data pipelines include one or more timestamps, either contained in the [source events](/docs/products/flink/concepts/event-processing-time) or generated by [window aggregations](/docs/products/flink/concepts/windows).

When the output of the Apache Flink® data pipeline is an Aiven for
OpenSearch® index, convert the Flink timestamps to a format
recognizable by OpenSearch®, otherwise they will be interpreted as
strings, losing the benefits of time filtering.

OpenSearch® recognises the following as correct date/time formats:

-   `yyyy/MM/dd` for a **date** field
-   `HH:mm:ss` for a **time** field
-   `yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss` for a **timestamp** field

Structure the data pipeline output to follow one of the recognized formats.

## Define Apache Flink® target tables including timestamps for OpenSearch®

When the result of the data pipeline contains a timestamp column like
the below:

```
EVENT_TIME TIMESTAMP(3),
HOSTNAME STRING,
CPU DOUBLE
```

To push the data correctly to an OpenSearch® index, you'll need to set
the target column format as `STRING` in the Flink table definition,
like:

```
EVENT_TIME STRING,
HOSTNAME STRING,
CPU DOUBLE
```

Assuming the `EVENT_TIME` is a timestamp, you'll need to specify
it in the format understood by OpenSearch® using the `DATE_FORMAT`
function, like:

```
DATE_FORMAT(EVENT_TIME, 'yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss')
```

Once the pipeline is running, you can check that the `EVENT_TIME` field
in OpenSearch® is recognized as a timestamp.

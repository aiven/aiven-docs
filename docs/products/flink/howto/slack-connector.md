title: Create a Slack-based Apache Flink® table
---

With Aiven's Slack Connector for Apache Flink®, you can create sink
tables in your Flink application and set up statements to send alerts
and notifications to your designated Slack channel. This allows for
real-time monitoring and tracking of your Flink job progress and any
potential issues that may arise.

You can access the open-source Slack connect for Apache Flink on
Aiven's GitHub repository at [Slack Connector for Apache
Flink®](https://github.com/aiven/slack-connector-for-apache-flink).

## Prerequisites

-   Slack app created and ready for use. For more information, refer to
    the [Set-up Slack Application
    section](https://github.com/aiven/slack-connector-for-apache-flink)
    on the GitHub repository and the [Slack
    documentation](https://api.slack.com/start/apps).
-   Note the **channel ID** and **token value**, as these will be
    required in the sink connector Table SQL when configuring the
    connection in your Flink application.

## Configure Slack as sink for Flink application

To configure Slack as the target using the Slack connector for Apache
Flink, follow these steps:

1.  In the Aiven for Apache Flink service page, select **Application**
    from the left sidebar.
2.  Create a application or select an existing application for your
    desired
    [data service integration](/docs/products/flink/howto/create-integration).

:::note
If you are editing an existing application, you need to create a new
version of the application to make changes to the source or sink table.
:::

3.  In the **Add source tables** screen, select the option to add a new
    source table, edit an existing one, or import a source table. Select
    your integrated service and in the **Table SQL** section, enter the
    statement that will be used to create the table.
4.  In the **Add sink tables** screen, select the option to add a new
    sink table or edit an existing one.
5.  In the **Table SQL** section, set the connector to **slack** and
    enter the necessary token as shown in the example below:

```
CREATE TABLE channel_name (
channel_id STRING,
message STRING
) WITH (
    'connector' = 'slack',
    'token' = '<TOKEN>'
)
```

:::note
\* `channel_id` should contain the channel ID parameter. \* Replace the
`\<TOKEN\>` placeholder with the token you created in Slack
during the prerequisites.
:::

6.  Create the SQL statement to send notifications/alerts to the
    designated slack channel.

You can check the connection by running a query on the sink table. If
the data flows into the slack channel, the connection is successful.

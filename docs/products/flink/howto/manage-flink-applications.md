This section provides information on managing your Aiven for Apache
Flink® applications.

## Creating a new version of an application

To create a new version of the application deployed, follow these steps:

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), and select
    your Aiven for Apache Flink® service.
2.  From the left sidebar, select **Applications**.
3.  On the **Applications** landing page, click the application name
    for which you want to create a new version.

### For SQL application

1.  Click **Create new version**.
2.  In the **Create new version** page, modify the create statement,
    source, or sink tables as needed.
3.  Click **Save and deploy later**. You can see the new version listed
    in the versions drop-down list.
4.  To deploy the new version of the application,
    [stop](/docs/products/flink/howto/manage-flink-applications#stop-flink-application) any
    existing version that is running.
5.  Click **Create deployment**, and in the **Create new deployment**
    dialog:
    -   Select the version you want to deploy.
    -   Select the savepoint from where you want to deploy.
    -   Toggle **Restart on failure** to automatically restart Flink
        jobs upon failure.
    -   Enter the number of [parallel
        instances](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/datastream/execution/parallel/)
        you want to have for the task.
    -   Click **Deploy from a savepoint** or **Deploy without
        savepoint** depending on your previous selection.

### For JAR application

1.  Click **Upload new version**.
2.  In the **Upload new version** dialog:
    -   Click **Choose file** to select your custom JAR file.
    -   Review and accept the terms of service by checking the box.
    -   Click **Upload version** to upload your JAR file.
3.  In the **Deployment history** you can see the latest version
    running.

## Stop application deployment {#stop-flink-application}

To stop a deployment for your Flink application, follow these steps:

1.  In your Aiven for Apache Flink service, select **Applications** from
    the left sidebar.
2.  On the **Applications** landing page, click the application name
    you want to stop.
3.  In the application's overview page, click **Stop deployment**.
4.  In the **Stop deployment** dialog, enable the option to **Create a
    savepoint before stopping** to save the current state of the
    application. If you want to stop a deployment without saving the
    current state of the application, disable the option for **Create a
    savepoint before stopping** and click **Stop without creating
    savepoint**.
5.  Click **Create savepoint & stop** to initiate the stopping process.

The application status will display `Saving_and_stop_requested` and then
`Finished` once the stopping process is completed.

Additionally, the **Deployment history** provides a record of all the
application deployments and statuses.

title: Create Apache Flink® data service integrations
---

With Apache Flink®, you can create streaming data pipelines across
services. Aiven for Apache Flink® currently supports Aiven for Apache
Kafka®, Aiven for PostgreSQL®, and Aiven for OpenSearch® as sources and
targets for Flink applications.

To use Aiven for Apache Kafka, Aiven for PostgreSQL, or Aiven for
OpenSearch as a source or target for a Flink application, you will need
to integrate the related service with Aiven for Apache Flink.

## Create data service integration

You can easily create Aiven for Apache Flink® data service integrations
via the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) by following these
steps:

1.  Navigate to the Aiven for Apache Flink® service page.

2.  If you are setting up the first integration for the selected Aiven
    for Apache Flink service, select **Get Started** in the service
    **Overview** screen.

    Apache Kafka®, Aiven for PostgreSQL®, or Aiven for OpenSearch®
    service that you wish to integrate. Click the **Integrate** button

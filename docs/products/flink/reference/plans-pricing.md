## Service plans

Aiven for Apache Flink is packaged into two tiers, each including a
range of plans to suit the size of your workloads and currently
available on AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure cloud environments. All
services and infrastructure are single-tenant and dedicated solely to a
single customer, which ensures a high level of security and isolation
for your data.

-   Business - high-availability plan for business-focused apps and
    internal services
-   Premium - high-availability plan that can handle high query rates
    and large amounts of data for mission-critical applications.

## Custom plans

Aiven for Apache Flink plans are optimized for working well in the
various clouds supported by Aiven. The plans also enable migration
between the clouds. Should any available plans not be an ideal fit for
your workload, we can tailor a custom plan for you to better
suit your needs.

## Billing

All Aiven services, including Aiven for Apache Flink, are billed based
on actual usage, which means you only pay for what you use: no up-front
fees and no termination charges.

The minimum hourly charge unit is one hour. Powering off or deleting a
service stops the accumulation of charges immediately. We calculate your
final bill based on your consumption over that period and deliver it as
a single invoice per project. For generating a consolidated invoice
across multiple projects, [manage billing groups in Aiven
Console](/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups).

### Billing on partial hours

Minutes of usage are rounded to the nearest hour. However, the one-hour
minimum charge unit still applies.

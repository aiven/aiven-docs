At a high level, Flink has a runtime architecture consisting of two types of processes: a **JobManager** and one or more **TaskManager**.

## JobManager

The JobManager is the central coordination point of Flink and is
responsible for managing the execution of Flink jobs. It is responsible
for scheduling tasks, managing task execution, and coordinating the
overall execution of the Flink application. In other words, Flink
provides an exactly once processing guarantee, only if JobManager is
always up and running.

Some responsibilities of the JobManager include:

-   **Scheduling tasks:** The JobManager decides when to schedule the
    next task (or set of tasks) for execution based on the availability
    of resources and the dependencies between tasks.
-   **Monitoring task execution:** The JobManager monitors the execution
    of tasks and responds to finished tasks or execution failures.
-   **Coordinating checkpoints:** The JobManager coordinates the
    execution of checkpoints, which are periodic snapshots of the state
    of the Flink application. Checkpoints are used to enable recovery of
    the Flink application in the event of a failure.
-   **Coordinating recovery on failures:** In the event of a failure,
    the JobManager coordinates recovery by re-executing failed tasks or
    rolling back to a previous checkpoint.

In a high-availability setup, there may be multiple JobManagers running
in the cluster, with one JobManager designated as the leader and the
others as standby JobManagers.

The JobManager in Apache Flink consists of three main components:

-   **ResourceManager:** The ResourceManager is responsible for managing
    the allocation and deallocation of resources in the Flink cluster.
    Additionally, ResourceManger is responsible for managing **Task
    slots** - the unit of resource scheduling in a Flink cluster.
-   **Dispatcher:** The Dispatcher in Apache Flink ensures tasks run
    smoothly on the cluster by scheduling them on available task slots
    and ensuring that tasks are executed efficiently.
-   **JobMaster:** The JobMaster in Apache Flink makes sure a specific
    job runs smoothly on the cluster by coordinating the tasks and
    executing them correctly and efficiently.

## TaskManager

TaskManager is responsible for executing the tasks assigned to them by
the JobManager and exchanging data with other TaskManagers as needed.
This direct communication between TaskManagers allows for efficient data
exchange and helps improve the Flink runtime performance. TaskManagers
also communicate with the JobManager to report progress and request
necessary resources. This enables the JobManager to monitor the progress
of tasks and to allocate resources accordingly to ensure optimal
performance.

In addition to the JobManager and TaskManager processes, Apache Flink
also has a number of other components, including **DataStream API** and
**DataSet API** for submitting jobs to the Flink runtime, a
configuration system for setting up and tuning the Flink runtime, and a
number of libraries and connectors for working with various data sources
and sinks.

title: Savepoints
---

Savepoints in Aiven for Apache FlinkÂ® are snapshots of the current state of your [Flink application](/docs/products/flink/howto/create-flink-applications).
They are created when stopping an application deployment
and allow you to restart it later on without losing any progress or state.

Additionally, savepoints play a crucial role in disaster recovery for
Aiven for Apache Flink Service. In the event of a failure or
interruption, you can use savepoints to resume or restart your
application (or Flink job) from the last known state, ensuring that you
do not lose any progress.

When you use Aiven for Apache Flink, explicitly trigger the creation of
savepoints for an application when you stop it.

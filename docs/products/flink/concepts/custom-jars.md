resources for functionalities beyond standard Java or Apache Flink
libraries. The capabilities of any custom JAR are defined by your
organization and use cases, allowing for tailored solutions that meet
specific technical requirements and objectives.

Using Custom JARs in Aiven for Apache Flink offers several key benefits:

-   **Enhanced functionality:** Using custom JARs, you can extend the
    native capabilities of your Aiven for Apache Flink service,
    incorporating functionalities that go beyond the core Flink APIs.
-   **Code reuse:** This feature allows you to seamlessly reuse and
    integrate your existing Java code into your Aiven for Apache Flink
    applications.
-   **Simplified management:** Aiven handles the complexities of hosting
    and operating a Flink service. This streamlined approach requires
    you only to upload and deploy the JAR file, enabling direct use of
    its functionalities within the Aiven for Apache Flink application.

## Use cases

Custom JARs can be applied in various scenarios, including but not
limited to:

-   **Custom data processing and enrichment:** Custom JARs facilitate
    the processing and enrichment of data from sources not natively
    supported by Flink's core APIs. This includes implementing unique
    data processing logic and applying custom functions for data
    transformation and enrichment.

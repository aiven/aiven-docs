title: Aiven for Apache Flink® applications
---

An Aiven for Apache Flink® Application is an abstraction layer that
simplifies building data processing pipelines in Apache Flink. It
supports two types of applications:

-   **SQL applications:** Built on top of Apache Flink SQL, these
    applications include elements like source and sink table
    definitions, data processing logic using SQL, deployment parameters,
    and other necessary metadata.
-   **JAR applications:** This type allows users to upload and deploy
    custom JAR files, enabling the integration of custom code and
    resources for specialized functionalities beyond the standard Flink
    capabilities.

[Applications](/docs/products/flink/howto/create-flink-applications) are the starting point for running an Apache Flink job
within the Aiven managed service. The [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) provides a user-friendly, guided
wizard to help you build and deploy applications, create source and sink
tables, write transformation statements, and validate and ingest data
using the interactive query feature.

Each application whether SQL or JAR-based, is designed to perform
specific data transformation tasks, allowing you to map and manage
different workflows within the Aiven for Apache Flink service. For
example, you can create a SQL application to process user IDs from one
topic and publish them on another, or use a custom JAR application for
more specialized data processing needs.

Applications significantly improve the developer experience and simplify
the development and deployment of Flink applications. Applications are
**automatically versioned** on every edit of the underline definition
(tables, transformation SQL, or custom JARs), allowing you to experiment
with new transformations and revert to a previously stored definition if
the result of the edits doesn't meet expectations.

## Application features

Some of key feature of Aiven for Flink applications include:

-   **Intuitive interface**: The [Aiven
    Console](https://console.aiven.io/) provides a user-friendly, guided
    wizard for building and deploying applications.
-   **Source and sink tables** definition with **SQL autocomplete**: For
    SQL applications, create source and sink tables with guidance from
    SQL autocomplete based on connector types.
-   **Interactive query**: For SQL applications, the interactive query
    feature allows you to validate and preview your data in the table or
    SQL transformation before deploying it.
-   **Start and stop**: You can start and stop applications stop and
    start anytime.
-   **Versioning**: Creating a new application version after editing the
    table or data transformation definition allows you to track changes
    and revert to a previous version when needed.
-   **Savepoints**: You can stop your application with a savepoint,
    allowing you to restart it from the previous state at a later time.
-   **Scalability:** You can parallelize the workload into multiple
    tasks and executing them concurrently in a cluster

## Limitations

-   **Concurrent applications:** You can create and run up to 4
    concurrent applications in the Aiven for Apache Flink service.
-   **Savepoints:** You can store up to 10 savepoints history per
    application deployment, allowing you to start from a previous state
    if necessary. If you exceed this limit, you must clear the
    savepoints history before creating a new application deployment.

## Application status

Flink applications can have different statuses based on their execution
and savepoint state. Below are the most common statuses you may
encounter:

-   **CANCELED**: Your application has stopped without creating a
    savepoint.
-   **CREATED**: Your application has been created but has yet to start
    running.
-   **FAILED**: Your application attempted to run but was unsuccessful.
-   **FINISHED**: Your application has completed its execution and
    stopped, with a savepoint created.
-   **INITIALIZING**: Your application is in the process of being
    initialized and preparing to run.
-   **RUNNING**: Your application is actively running. You can view its
    current version.
-   **RESTARTING**: Your application is being restarted.
-   **SAVING_AND_STOP**: Your application is currently saving its
    current state in a savepoint and then stopping.

Other statuses and transient statuses include:

-   **CANCELLING_REQUESTED**: A stop request for your application has
    been made without creating a savepoint.
-   **CANCELLING**: Your application is currently being stopped.
-   **DELETE_REQUESTED**: A request to delete your application has been
    initiated.
-   **DELETING**: Your application is in the process of being removed.
-   **FAILING**: Your application is encountering issues and failing.
-   **RESTARTING**: Your application is undergoing a restart process.
-   **SAVING**: Your application is creating a savepoint.
-   **SAVING_AND_STOP_REQUESTED**: A request has been made to save the
    current state of your application in a savepoint and then stop it.
-   **SUSPENDED**: Your application has been suspended.

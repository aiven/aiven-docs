title: Built-in SQL editor
---

The built-in Table SQL editor in the [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) for Aiven for Apache Flink® service
provides an intuitive interface that allows you to create source and
sink tables, write queries, and analyze data in one place. Additionally,
the editor includes an auto-completion feature for SQL keywords, which
makes the query-writing process faster and more efficient for you and
helps with data validation.

The interactive query feature also lets you preview the data of a Flink
table or job without outputting the rows to a sink table. This is useful
for testing and debugging your Flink application since it allows you to
view the data that your application is processing.

title: Disaster recovery in Aiven for ClickHouse®
---

Disaster recovery is a process of coping with emergencies or crises
using dedicated methods for protecting resources and/or reestablishing
their desired status. In the context of data infrastructure,
well-established disaster recovery methods are of a particular
importance for preventing data loss or corruption. Software failure,
loss of an availability zone, or datacenter outage are only a few
examples of emergencies when disaster recovery comes in. This article
helps you understand how Aiven for ClickHouse® prevents and mitigates
such emergencies and what disaster recovery methods it uses to keep your
data safe and sound.

## High availability

High availability (HA) is an entity's ability to continuously maintain
a certain level of operational performance for a desired period of time.
HA is typically achieved by redundancy - securing replicas of databases
or services to be highly available. To support disaster recovery
technologies, a database service needs to stay highly available, for
example, by operating on a few nodes holding the same data.

With Aiven, HA for your service is supported in business and premium
plans. See [Plan
comparison](https://aiven.io/pricing?tab=plan-comparison&product=clickhouse)
for details.

## Backup and restore

### Backups

Backups of Aiven for ClickHouse services happen automatically on a daily
basis.

They cover the following:

-   Access entities (for example, users, roles, passwords, or secrets)
    stored in Zookeeper
-   Database definitions
-   Table schemas
-   Table content (`part files`)

:::note[Part files]
With the ClickHouse's ReplicatedMergeTree table engine, each INSERT
query results in creating a new file, so-called part, written only once
and not modifiable.

Using part files allows incremental backups in Aiven for ClickHouse:
only changed parts are backed up and files already available in the
object storage are left out from the backup.
:::

### Recovery

The restoration of a backup of an Aiven for ClickHouse service is
performed on a running ClickHouse server and proceeds as a regular
power-on of the service. The restoration happens only for powering up a
service after powering it down or forking a service.

For more information on backups in Aiven, see
[Backups at Aiven](/docs/platform/concepts/service_backups).

## Sharding

Essentially, sharding is a technique of splitting database rows across
multiple database nodes, which usually significantly increases
performance. However, integrating sharding with database replication
technologies, data can be replicated across shards of the sharded
database. Replication at the shard level provides high availability and
helps to achieve disaster recovery. A shard group can be replicated to
one or more data centers, which improves the disaster recovery
capability.

With Aiven for ClickHouse [business and premium
plans](https://aiven.io/pricing?tab=plan-comparison&product=clickhouse),
each shard is replicated across three availability zones. The service
and the data stay fully available even if an entire availability zone is
lost.

:::note
Although sharding with replicated nodes can reduce failures, it still
cannot save a service from the loss of an entire region.

For information on how to work with shards in Aiven for ClickHouse, see
[Enable reading and writing data across shards](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/use-shards-with-distributed-table).

## Limitations

Aiven for ClickHouse has a few restrictions on the disaster recovery
capability.

-   No backup to another region
-   No point in time recovery (PITR)

For all the restrictions and limits for Aiven for ClickHouse, see
[Aiven for ClickHouse limits and limitations](/docs/products/clickhouse/reference/limitations).

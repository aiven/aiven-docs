## About the core functionality

Aiven for ClickHouse is a fully managed distributed columnar database
which is built on the open source ClickHouse solution. It is a fast
highly-scalable fault-tolerant database designed for online analytical
processing (OLAP) and data warehousing. Aiven for ClickHouse enables you
to execute complex SQL queries on large datasets quickly and effectively
to process large amounts of data in real time. On top of that, it
supports built-in data integrations for Aiven for Kafka® and Aiven for
PostgreSQL®.

## Effortless setup

With the managed ClickHouse service, you can offload on Aiven multiple
time-consuming and laborious operations on your data infrastructure:
database initialization and configuration, cluster provisioning and
management, or your infrastructure maintenance and monitoring are off
your shoulders.

**Pre-configured settings:** The managed ClickHouse service is
pre-configured with a rational set of parameters and settings
appropriate for the plan you have selected. You can easily launch
production-ready ClickHouse clusters in minutes in a cloud of your
choice.

## Easy management

-   **Scalability:** You can seamlessly
    [scale your ClickHouse cluster](/docs/platform/howto/scale-services) horizontally or vertically as your data and needs change
    using the pre-packaged plans. Aiven for ClickHouse also supports
    [sharding](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/use-shards-with-distributed-table) as a horizontal cluster scaling strategy.
-   **Resource tags:** You can assign metadata to your services in the
    form of tags. They help you organize, search, and filter Aiven
    resources. You can
    [tag your service](/docs/platform/howto/tag-resources) by purpose, owner, environment, or any other criteria.
-   **Forking:** Forking an Aiven for ClickHouse service creates a new
    database service containing the latest snapshot of an existing
    service. Forks don't stay up-to-date with the parent database, but
    you can write to them. It provides a risk-free way of working with
    your production data and schema. For example, you can use them to
    test upgrades, new schema migrations, or load test your app with a
    different plan. Learn how to
    [fork an Aiven service](/docs/platform/concepts/service-forking).

## Effective maintenance

-   **Automatic maintenance updates:** With 99.99% SLA, Aiven makes sure
    that the ClickHouse software and the underlying platform stays
    up-to-date with the latest patches and updates with zero downtime.
    You can set
    [maintenance windows](/docs/platform/concepts/maintenance-window) for your service to make sure the changes occur during
    times that do not affect productivity.
-   **Backups and disaster recovery:** Aiven for ClickHouse has
    automatic backups taken every 24 hours. The retention period depends
    on your plan tier. Check out the details on [Plan
    comparison](https://aiven.io/pricing?product=clickhouse&tab=plan-comparison).

## Intelligent observability

-   **Service health monitoring:** Aiven for ClickHouse provides metrics
    and logs for your cluster at no additional charge. You can enable
    pre-integrated Aiven observability services, such as Grafana®, M3®,
    or OpenSearch® or push available metrics and logs to external
    observability tools, such as Prometheus, AWS CloudWatch, or Google
    Cloud Logging. For more details, see
    [Monitor Aiven for ClickHouse metrics](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/monitor-performance).
-   **Notifications and alerts:** The service is pre-configured to alert
    you on, for example, your disk running out of space or CPU
    consumption running high when resource usage thresholds are
    exceeded. Email notifications are sent to admins and technical
    contacts of the project under which your service is created. Check
    [Receive technical notifications](/docs/platform/howto/technical-emails) to learn how you can sign up for such alerts.

## Security and compliance

-   **Single tenancy:** Your service runs on dedicated instances, thus
    offering true data isolation that contributes to the optimal
    protection and an increased security.
-   **Network isolation:** Aiven platform supports VPC peering as a
    mechanism for connecting directly to your ClickHouse service via
    private IP, thus providing a more secure network setup. The platform
    also supports PrivateLink connectivity.
-   **Regulatory compliance:** ClickHouse runs on Aiven platform that is
    ISO 27001:2013, SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI/DSS compliant.

Role based Access Control (RBAC) To learn what kind of granular access
is possible in Aiven for ClickHouse, check out
[RBAC with Zookeeper](/docs/products/clickhouse/concepts/service-architecture#zookeeper).


-   **Zero lock-in:** Aiven for ClickHouse offers compatibility with
    open source software (OSS), which protects you from software and
    vendor lock-in. You can easily migrate between clouds and regions.

## Devops-friendly tools

-   **Automation:** [Aiven Provider for
    Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs)
    helps you automate the orchestration of your ClickHouse clusters.
-   **Command-line tooling:**
    [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli) client
    provides greater flexibility of use for proficient administrators
    allowing scripting repetitive actions with ease.
-   **REST APIs:** [Aiven APIs](/docs/tools/api) allow you to manage Aiven resources in a programmatic
    way using HTTP requests. The whole functionality available via Aiven
    Console is also available via APIs enabling you to build custom
    integrations with ClickHouse and the Aiven platform.

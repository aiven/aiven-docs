    <tr>
      <td>Backups - one snapshot a day</td>
      <td>
        Since Aiven for ClickHouse service takes a single snapshot a day only:
        <ul>
          <li>When powering off the service, all data after the last backup is lost.</li>
          <li>Point-in-time recovery is not supported. A database can be restored to
            one of the daily backups states only.</li>
            <li>When creating a database fork,
            you can only create a fork that matches the state of one of the backups.</li>
          <li>Any data inserted before the next snapshot is lost if all nodes in a
            given shard malfunction and need to be replaced. This limitation doesn't
            apply to patches, migrations, or scaling, which are handled safely and
            automatically.</li>

          should use it for inserts too.

          Use a distributed table with sharded plans. Check

          Aiven for ClickHouse doesn't support ON CLUSTER queries because it

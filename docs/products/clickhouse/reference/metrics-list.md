Browse through metrics that are available via Grafana速 for Aiven for
ClickHouse速 services.

## Current counts

The following metrics are displayed on the monitoring dashboard as
counts reflecting the current status:

-   `Databases`: Number of databases
-   `Tables`: Number of tables
-   `Parts`: Total number of MergeTree table parts
-   `Rows total`: Total number of rows
-   `Running Queries`: Total number of queries currently executed
-   `Running Merges`: Number of merges currently executed in the
    background
-   `Parts Merged`: Number of times data parts of ReplicatedMergeTree
    tables were successfully merged
-   `Readonly Tables`: Number of replicated tables that are currently in
    the read-only state due to re-initialization after ZooKeeper session
    loss or due to startup without ZooKeeper configured

## Charts

The following metrics are displayed on the monitoring dashboard as
charts reflecting data changes over time:

### `Connections`

-   Number of connections to the TCP server (clients with native
    interface), also included server-server distributed query
    connections
-   Number of connections to the HTTP server
-   Number of connections from other replicas to fetch parts

### `Queries`

-   Number of executed SELECT queries (includes internal/monitoring
    queries)
-   Number of executed INSERT queries
-   Number of failed queries

### `Delayed Queries`

-   Number of INSERT queries that are throttled due to high number of
    active data parts for partition in a MergeTree table
-   Number of queries that are stopped and waiting due to \'priority\'
    setting

### `Replicated Part Fetches`

-   Number of data parts being checked for consistency
-   Number of data parts being fetched from replica Each fetch consumes
    disk IO and inter-server network IO.

### Miscellaneous

-   `Running Merges` Merge operations reduce the number of parts and
    improve SELECT performance. Each merge consumes disk IO (read and
    write). A new part will be merged approximately 15 min after being
    inserted.
-   `Inserted Rows`: Number of rows INSERTed to all tables
-   `Inserted Bytes`: Number of bytes (uncompressed) INSERTed to all
    tables
-   `Merged Rows`: Rows read for background merges (before merge)
-   `Merged: Data Read`: Uncompressed bytes that were read for
    background merges
-   `Compressed Data Read`: Number of bytes before decompression read
    from compressed sources
-   `Rows Delta`: Difference in number of rows between nodes
-   `Parts`: Total number of MergeTree table parts. Each INSERT creates
    a new part.
-   `Replicated Part Merged`

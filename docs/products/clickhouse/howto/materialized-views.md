Learn how to create and use materialized views to persist data from the
Kafka® table engine.

## About materialized views

One way of integrating your ClickHouse® service with Kafka® is using the
Kafka® table engine, which enables, for example, inserting data into
ClickHouse® from Kafka.

In such a scenario, ClickHouse can read from a Kafka® topic directly.
This is, however, one-time retrieval so the data cannot be re-read. When
a new block of data is inserted in a table (whether the table is backed
by a MergeTree or Kafka® engine), the table expression defined by the
materialized view is triggered with the block of data. With Kafka®, the
block of data lives in a buffer in memory and the trigger *flushes* the
buffer. For this reason, the data consumed from the topic by the Kafka®
engine cannot be read twice.

Persisting the data from the Kafka® table engine read requires capturing
and inserting it into a different table. Here's where materialized
views come in. A materialized view triggers a read on the table engine.
The destination of the data (for example, a Merge Tree family table) is
defined by the TO clause. This process is illustrated in the following
diagram:

```mermaid

  a[Kafka topic]
  b{{Kafka table engine}}
  c[Materialized view]
  d{{Merge Tree<br /> family table}}
  a --> b --> c --> d
```

## Create a materialized view

To store the Kafka® messages by creating a materialized view on top of
the Kafka® table, you need to run the following query:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW default.my_view TO destination_name
ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree
ORDER BY x AS SELECT x,y FROM service_kaf.table_name
```

:::note
All ClickHouse® nodes share the same consumer group: Each message is
consumed and stored by a single node. However, since materialized views
use the ReplicatedMergeTree engine, the stored messages are exchanged
and replicated across all the nodes.

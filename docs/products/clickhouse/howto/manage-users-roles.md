title: Manage ClickHouse速 service users and roles
---

This article shows you how to create new user accounts for your service
and how to manage user roles and permissions for efficiently access
control.

## Add a new user

To create a user account for your service,

1.  Log in to the [Aiven web console](https://console.aiven.io/) and,
    select your ClickHouse速 service.

2.  Select **Users and roles** from the sidebar of your service's page.

    This page shows you a list of all the users that are currently
    available in your service. The default `avnadmin` user has all
    available access grants to the service.

    :::tip
    To view the roles and grants for any of the listed users, select
    **View details & grants** for that user.
    :::

3.  In the **Users and roles** page, select **Add user**.

4.  In the **Create a service user** window, enter a name for the
    new user and select a role.

    The role that you select defines the access grants that are assigned
    to the user. For more information on roles, see
    [Manage roles and permissions](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/manage-users-roles#manage-roles-and-permissions).

5.  Select **Add user**.

    This creates the new user and shows you a summary of the
    information.

6.  Copy the password on screen to a safe place. It can't be accessed
    again in future, however it can be reset if needed.

## Manage roles and permissions

ClickHouse速 supports a **Role Based Access Control** model and allows
you to configure access privileges by using SQL statements. You can
either [use the query editor](query-databases) or rely on
[the command-line interface](connect-with-clickhouse-cli).

This article shows you examples of how to create roles and grant
privileges. The ClickHouse documentation includes [detailed
documentation for access
rights](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/access-rights/).

### Create a role

To create a role named **auditor**, run the following command:

```
CREATE ROLE auditor;
```

You can find more information [on role creation
here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/role/).

### Grant permissions

You can grant permissions both to specific roles and to individual
users. The grants can be also granular, targeting specific databases,
tables, columns, or rows.

For example, the following request grants the `auditor` role permissions
to select data from the `transactions` database:

```
GRANT SELECT ON transactions.* TO auditor;
```

You can limit the grant to a specified table:

```
GRANT SELECT ON transactions.expenses TO auditor;
```

Or to particular columns of a table:

```
GRANT SELECT(date,description,amount) ON transactions.expenses TO auditor
```

To grant the `auditor` and `external` roles to several users, run:

```
GRANT auditor, external TO Mary.Anderson, James.Miller;
```

To allow the creation of new users:

```
GRANT CREATE USER ON transactions.* TO administrator
```

There are a variety of privileges that you can grant, and you can find
[the full list in the ClickHouse
documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant/#privileges).

:::note
You can grant permissions to a table that does not yet exist.
:::

:::note
Users can grant permissions according to their privileges. If the user
lacks the required permissions for a requested operation, they receive a
`Not enough privileges` exception.
:::

:::warning
Privileges are not revoked when a table or database is removed. They
continue to be active for any new table or database that is created with
the same name.
:::

You can find the full list of supported functionality related [to grants
in the ClickHouse
documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant/).

### Set roles

A single user can be assigned different roles, either individually or
simultaneously.

```
SET ROLE auditor;
```

You can also specify a role to be activated by default when the user
logs in:

```
SET DEFAULT ROLE auditor, external TO Mary.Anderson, James.Miller;
```

### Delete a role

If you no longer need a role, you can remove it:

```
DROP ROLE auditor;
```

### Revoke permissions

Remove all or specific privileges from users or roles:

```
REVOKE SELECT ON transactions.expenses FROM Mary.Anderson;
```

Revoke all privileges to a table or database simultaneously:

```
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON database.table FROM external;
```

See the ClickHouse documentation [for more information on revoking
privileges](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/revoke/).

### Check permissions

Run the following commands to see all available grants, users, and
roles:

```
SHOW GRANTS;
```

```
SHOW USERS;
```

```
SHOW ROLES;
```

### Preview users and roles in the console

You can also see the users, their roles, and permissions in the [Aiven
web console](https://console.aiven.io/). Go to your service page, and
select **Users and roles** from the sidebar. Next to every user listed,
there is a **View details & grants** button, which shows you a list of
all grants for that user.

## Manage using Terraform

You can also manage user roles and access using the
[Aiven Provider for Terraform](/docs/tools/terraform). Try Aiven Terraform Provider Cookbook recipe [Manage user
privileges for Aiven for ClickHouse速 services using
Terraform](https://aiven.io/developer/manage-user-privileges-clickhouse-terraform).

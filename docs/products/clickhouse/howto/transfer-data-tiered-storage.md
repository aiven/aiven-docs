title: Transfer data between storage devices in Aiven for ClickHouseÂ®'s tiered storage
limited: true
---

After [enabling](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/enable-tiered-storage) the tiered storage feature, you can move your data from SSD to object storage. Next, you may want to size down your SSD by selecting a service plan with less SSD capacity. Later, you can move your data from object storage back to your SSD if needed. Both operations can be performed using SQL statements against your tables directly.

## Prerequisites

-   Tiered storage feature
    [enabled](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/enable-tiered-storage) at project level

    :::note
    This feature is in [limited availability](/docs/platform/concepts/beta_services).
    [Contact the sales team](mailto:sales@aiven.io) to enable it for your project.
    :::

-   Aiven organization
-   Command line tool
    ([ClickHouse client](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/connect-with-clickhouse-cli))

## Transfer data from SSD to object storage

If you
[enable](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/enable-tiered-storage) the tiered storage feature on your table, by default your
data is moved from SSD to object storage as soon as the SSD reaches 80%
of its capacity. You can also
[configure your tiered storage](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/configure-tiered-storage) so that data is moved to object storage at a specific time.

1.  [Connect to your Aiven for ClickHouse service](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/list-connect-to-service) using, for example, the ClickHouse client (CLI).

2.  Run the following query:

    ``` bash
    ALTER TABLE database-name.tablename MODIFY SETTING storage_policy = 'tiered'
    ```

Now, with the tiered storage feature
[enabled](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/enable-tiered-storage), your data is moved from SSD to object storage when the SSD
reaches 80% of its capacity.

## Transfer data from object storage to SSD

Use the MOVE statement [MOVE
PARTITION\|PART](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition#move-partitionpart)
to transfer data to your SSD.

1.  [Connect to your Aiven for ClickHouse service](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/list-connect-to-service) using, for example, the ClickHouse client (CLI).

2.  Select a database for operations you intend to perform.

    ``` bash
    USE database-name
    ```

3.  Run the following query:

    ``` bash
    ALTER TABLE table_name MOVE PARTITION partition_expr TO VOLUME 'default'
    ```

Your data has been moved to the SSD.

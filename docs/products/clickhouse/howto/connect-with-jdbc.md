title: Connect Aiven for ClickHouse® to external databases via JDBC
---

You can use [ClickHouse JDBC
driver](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-jdbc/tree/master/clickhouse-jdbc)
to connect external sources to your Aiven for ClickHouse database.

You will need Aiven for ClickHouse® service, accessible by HTTPS. The
connection values you need can be found in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) > your service's page >
**Overview** > **Connection information** > **ClickHouse HTTPS &
JDBC**.

 | Variable                | Description                                    |
 | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
 | `CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_HOST` | HTTPS service host of your ClickHouse service. |
 | `CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_PORT` | HTTPS service port of your ClickHouse service. |
 | `CLICKHOUSE_USER`       | Username to access ClickHouse service.         |
 | `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`   | Password to access ClickHouse service.         |

## Connection string

Replace `CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_HOST` and `CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_PORT` with your
connection values:

```
jdbc:ch://CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_HOST:CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_PORT?ssl=true&sslmode=STRICT
```

You\'ll also need to provide user name and password to establish the
connection. For example, if you use Java:

```
Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection("CLICKHOUSE_USER", "CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD");
```

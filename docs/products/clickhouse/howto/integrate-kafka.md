title: Connect Apache Kafka® to Aiven for ClickHouse®
---

You can integrate Aiven for ClickHouse® with either *Aiven for Apache
Kafka®* service located in the same project, or *an external Apache
Kafka endpoint*. A single Aiven for ClickHouse instance can connect to
multiple Kafka clusters with different authentication mechanism and
credentials.

Behind the scenes the integration between Aiven for ClickHouse and
Apache Kafka services relies on [ClickHouse Kafka
Engine](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/integrations/kafka/).

:::note
Aiven for ClickHouse service integrations are available for Startup
plans and higher.
:::

## Prerequisites

You will need

-   Aiven for ClickHouse service

-   Aiven for Apache Kafka service or a self-hosted Apache Kafka service

    :::tip
    If you use the self-hosted Apache Kafka service, an external Apache
    Kafka endpoint should be configured in **Integration endpoints**.
    :::

-   At least one topic in the Apache Kafka service

## Variables

The following variables will be used later in the code snippets:

| Variable                  | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLICKHOUSE_SERVICE_NAME` | Name of your Aiven for ClickHouse service.                                                                 |
| `KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME`      | Name of the Apache Kafka service you use for the integration.                                              |
| `PROJECT`                 | Name of Aiven project where your services are located.                                                     |
| `CONNECTOR_TABLE_NAME`    | Name of the Kafka engine virtual table that is used as a connector.                                        |
| [DATA_FORMAT`             | Input/output data format in which data is accepted into Aiven for ClickHouse. See [Reference](#reference). |
| `CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME`     | Name of the consumer group. Each message is delivered once per consumer group.                             |

## Create an integration

To connect Aiven for ClickHouse and Aiven for Apache Kafka by enabling a
data service integration, see
[Create data service integrations](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/data-service-integration#create-data-service-integration).

The newly created database name has the following format:
`service_KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME`, where KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME is the name of
your Apache Kafka service.

:::note
During this step we only created an empty database in Aiven for
ClickHouse, but we didn't create any tables yet. Creation of the
virtual connector table is done by setting specific integration
configuration, see the section below.
:::

## Update Apache Kafka integration settings

Next step is to configure the topic and data format options for the
integration. This will create a virtual table in Aiven for ClickHouse
that can receive and send messages from multiple topics. You can have as
many of such tables as you need.

For each table, there are mandatory and optional setting to be defined.

### Mandatory settings

For each table, you need to define the following:

-   `name` - name of the connector table
-   `columns` - array of columns, with names and types
-   `topics` - array of topics, where you want to bring the data from
-   `data_format` - your preferred format for data input, see
    [Formats for ClickHouse®-Kafka® data exchange](/docs/products/clickhouse/reference/supported-input-output-formats)
-   `group_name` - consumer group name, that will be created on your
    behalf

```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "CONNECTOR_TABLE_NAME",
      "columns": [
          {"name": "id", "type": "UInt64"},
          {"name": "name", "type": "String"}
      ],
      "topics": [{"name": "topic1"}, {"name": "topic2"}],
      "data_format": "DATA_FORMAT",
      "group_name": "CONSUMER_NAME"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Optional settings

For each table, you can define the following optional settings:

## Configure integration with CLI

Currently the configurations can be set only with the help of CLI
command
[avn service integration-update](/docs/tools/cli/service/integration#avn%20service%20integration-update)

Follow these instructions:

1.  Get *the service integration id* by requesting the full list of
    integrations. Replace `PROJECT`, `CLICKHOUSE_SERVICE_NAME` and
    `KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME` with the names of your services:

```
avn service integration-list                        \
--project PROJECT_NAME                                   \
CLICKHOUSE_SERVICE_NAME | grep KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME
```

2.  Update the configuration settings using the service integration id
    retrieved in the previous step and your integration settings.
    Replace `SERVICE_INTEGRATION_ID`, `CONNECTOR_TABLE_NAME`,
    `DATA_FORMAT` and `CONSUMER_NAME` with your values:

```
avn service integration-update SERVICE_INTEGRATION_ID \
--project PROJECT_NAME                                \
--user-config-json '{
    "tables": [
        {
            "name": "CONNECTOR_TABLE_NAME",
            "columns": [
                {"name": "id", "type": "UInt64"},
                {"name": "name", "type": "String"}
            ],
            "topics": [{"name": "topic1"}, {"name": "topic2"}],
            "data_format": "DATA_FORMAT",
            "group_name": "CONSUMER_NAME"
        }
    ]
}'
```

## Read and store data

In Aiven for ClickHouse you can consume messages by running SELECT
command. Replace `KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME` and `CONNECTOR_TABLE_NAME` with
your values and run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM service_KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME.CONNECTOR_TABLE_NAME
```

However, the messages are only read once (per consumer group). If you
want to store the messages for later, you can send them into a separate
ClickHouse table with the help of a materialized view.

For example, run to creating a destination table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE destination (id UInt64, name String)
ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree()
ORDER BY id;
```

Add a materialised view to bring the data from the connector:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW materialised_view TO destination AS
SELECT *
FROM service_KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME.CONNECTOR_TABLE_NAME;
```

Now the messages consumed from the Apache Kafka topic will be read
automatically and sent into the destination table directly.

For more information on materialized views, see
[Create materialized views in ClickHouse®](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/materialized-views).

:::note
ClickHouse is strict about allowed symbols in database and table names.
You can use backticks around the names when running ClickHouse requests,
particularly in the cases when the name contains dashes.
:::

## Write data back to the topic

You can also bring the entries from ClickHouse table into the Apache
Kafka topic. Replace `KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME` and `CONNECTOR_TABLE_NAME`
with your values:

```sql
INSERT INTO service_KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME.CONNECTOR_TABLE_NAME(id, name)
VALUES (1, 'Michelangelo')
```

:::warning
Writing to more than one topic is not supported.

## Reference

When connecting ClickHouse® to Kafka® using Aiven integrations, data
exchange requires using specific formats. Check the supported formats
for input and output data in
[Formats for ClickHouse®-Kafka® data exchange](/docs/products/clickhouse/reference/supported-input-output-formats).

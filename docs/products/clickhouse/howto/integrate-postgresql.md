title: Connect PostgreSQL® to Aiven for ClickHouse®
---

You can integrate Aiven for ClickHouse® with either *Aiven for
PostgreSQL* service located in the same project, or *an external
PostgreSQL endpoint*.

Behind the scenes the integration between Aiven for ClickHouse and
PostgreSQL relies on [ClickHouse PostgreSQL
Engine](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/integrations/postgresql).

:::note
Aiven for ClickHouse service integrations are available for Startup
plans and higher.
:::

## Prerequisites

To connect Aiven for ClickHouse to PostgreSQL, you need the following:

-   Aiven for ClickHouse service
-   Aiven for PostgreSQL service or a self-hosted PostgreSQL service

These instructions assume that you have at least one table in your
PostgreSQL service.

:::tip
If you use the self-hosted PostgreSQL service, an external PostgreSQL
endpoint should be configured in **Integration endpoints**.
:::

## Variables

The following variables will be used later in the code snippets:

| Variable                  | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLICKHOUSE_SERVICE_NAME` | Name of your Aiven for ClickHouse service.                  |
| `PG_SERVICE_NAME`         | Name of the PostgreSQL service you use for the integration. |
| `PG_DATABASE`             | Name of PostgreSQL database you're integrating.             |
| `PG_SCHEMA`               | Name of PostgreSQL schema.                                  |
| `PG_TABLE`                | Name of the PostgreSQL table you use for the integration.   |

## Create an integration

To connect Aiven for ClickHouse and Aiven for PostgreSQL by enabling a
data service integration, see
[Create data service integrations](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/data-service-integration#create-data-service-integration).

The newly created database name has the following format:
`service_PG_SERVICE_NAME_PG_DATABASE_PG_SCHEMA`, for example,
`service_myPGService_myDatabase_mySchema`.

:::note
When connecting to an Aiven for PostgreSQL, we connect as the main
service user of that service, which has access to all the PostgreSQL
tables. SELECT and INSERT privileges are granted to the main service
user (`avnadmin`). It is up to the main service user to grant access to
other users. Read more
[how to grant privileges](/docs/products/clickhouse/howto/manage-users-roles).
:::

## Update PostgreSQL integration settings

When connecting to a PostgreSQL service, ClickHouse needs to know the
name of the PostgreSQL schema and database you want to access. By
default these settings are set to the `public` schema in the
`defaultdb`. However, you can update these values by following next
steps.

:::note
Currently the configurations can be set only with the help of CLI
command
[avn service integration-update](/docs/tools/cli/service/integration#avn%20service%20integration-update).
:::

1.  Get *the service integration id* by requesting the full list of
    integrations. Replace `CLICKHOUSE_SERVICE_NAME` and
    `PG_SERVICE_NAME` with the names of your services:

    ```
    avn service integration-list --project PROJECT_NAME CLICKHOUSE_SERVICE_NAME | grep PG_SERVICE_NAME
    ```

1.  Update the configuration settings using the service integration id
    retrieved in the previous step and your integration settings.
    Replace `SERVICE_INTEGRATION_ID`, `PG_DATABASE` and `PG_SCHEMA` with
    your values, you can add more than one combination of
    database/schema in the object `databases`:

    ```
    avn service integration-update --project PROJECT_NAME SERVICE_INTEGRATION_ID \
    --user-config-json '{
        "databases":[{"database":"PG_DATABASE","schema":"PG_SCHEMA"}]
    }'
    ```

## Read and store data

In Aiven for ClickHouse you can read data by running SELECT command.
Replace `PG_SERVICE_NAME`, `PG_DATABASE`, `PG_SCHEMA` and `PG_TABLE`
with your values and run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM service_PG_SERVICE_NAME_PG_DATABASE_PG_SCHEMA.PG_TABLE
```

:::note
ClickHouse is strict about allowed symbols in database and table names.
You can use backticks around the names when running ClickHouse requests,
particularly in the cases when the name contains dashes. For example,
`` SELECT * FROM `service_your-kafka-service`.table ``.
:::

## Write data to PostgreSQL table

You can also insert rows from the ClickHouse table into the PostgreSQL
table. Replace `PG_SERVICE_NAME`, `PG_DATABASE`, `PG_SCHEMA` and
`PG_TABLE` with your values:

```sql
INSERT INTO service_PG_SERVICE_NAME_PG_DATABASE_PG_SCHEMA.PG_TABLE(id, name)
VALUES (1, 'Michelangelo')
```

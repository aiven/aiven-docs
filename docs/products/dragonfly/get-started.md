The first step in using Aiven for Dragonfly is to create a service. You
can do so either using the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) or
the [Aiven CLI](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client).

## Prerequisites

Aiven for Dragonfly速 is currently a **limited availability** service and requires activation
on your Aiven account. To explore this offering and request access for your account, contact our
sales team at sales@aiven.io.

## Create a service using the Aiven Console

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
1.  [Create a Dragonfly service](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service).

Once the service is ready, the status changes to *Running*. Depending on
your selected cloud provider and region, this generally takes a couple
of minutes.

## Create a service using the Aiven CLI

[Aiven CLI](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client) provides a simple and
efficient way to create an Aiven for Dragonfly速 service. If you prefer
launching a new service from the CLI, follow these steps:

1.  Determine the service plan, cloud provider, and region you want to
    use for your Dragonfly service.
1.  Run the following command to create Dragonfly service named
    dragonfly-demo:

```text
avn service create dragonfly-demo   \
    --service-type dragonfly                 \
    --cloud google-europe-north1             \
    --plan startup-4                         \
    --project dev-sandbox
```

:::note
There are additional options available to you, which you can view by
running the following commands:

-   For a full list of default flags: `avn service create -h`
-   For type-specific options: `avn service types -v`

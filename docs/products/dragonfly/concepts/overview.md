Aiven for Dragonfly redefines in-memory database performance, extending beyond the capabilities of traditional Redis®* solutions.

Dragonfly is designed to overcome the limitations of Redis Open Source
Software (Redis OSS), especially under high-load conditions. While
renowned for its speed and adaptability as an in-memory data repository,
Redis encounters limitations when handling large-scale data management
and achieving high throughput. Dragonfly addresses these challenges by
enabling vertical scaling, optimizing hardware resources, and supporting
larger memory footprints.

With Aiven for Dragonfly, businesses can handle workloads exceeding 1 TB
with more than 10 times the throughput performance of Redis OSS, along
with reduced latency. This makes it an ideal solution for enterprises
with growing data needs.

title: Connect with Python
---

This example demonstrates how to connect to DragonflyÂ® using Python,
using the `redis-py` library, which is officially supported by
Dragonfly. For more information, see [Dragonfly
SDKs](https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/development/sdks).

## Variables

Replace the following placeholders in the code sample with the
appropriate values:

 | Variable        | Description                      |
 | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
 | `DRAGONFLY_URI` | URL for the Dragonfly connection |

## Prerequisites

Install the `redis-py` library:

```
pip install redis
```

## Code

Create a file named `main.py`, add the following content and replace
the `DRAGONFLY_URI` placeholder with your Dragonfly instance's
connection URI:

```
import redis

# Replace with your Dragonfly URI
r = redis.Redis.from_url('DRAGONFLY_URI')

r.set('key', 'hello world')
value = r.get('key')
print(f'The value of key is: {value.decode()}')
```

This code connects to Dragonfly, sets a key named `key` with the value
`hello world` (without expiration), and retrieves and prints the
value of this key.

## Run the code

To execute the code, use the following command in your terminal:

```
python main.py
```

:::note
On some systems, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python` to
invoke `Python 3`.
:::

If everything is set up correctly, the output should be:

```
The value of key is: hello world
```

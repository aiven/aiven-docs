title: Connect with redis-cli
---

This example demonstrates how to connect to Dragonfly® using
`redis-cli`, which supports nearly all the same commands as it does for
Redis®. For more information, see [Dragonfly
CLI](https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/development/cli).

## Variables

Replace the following placeholders in the code sample with the
appropriate values:

 | Variable        | Description                      |
 | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
 | `DRAGONFLY_URI` | URL for the Dragonfly connection |

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following before proceeding:

1.  The `redis-cli` client installed. This can be installed as part of
    the Redis®\* server installation or as a standalone client. Refer to
    the [Redis Installation
    Guide](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/tutorial/) for more
    information.

## Code

To connect to Dragonfly, execute the following command in a terminal
window:

```
redis-cli -u DRAGONFLY_URI
```

This command connects you to your Dragonfly instance.

To verify the connection is successful, use the `INFO` command:

```
INFO
```

This command should return various Dragonfly parameters similar to
Redis:

```text
# Server
dragonfly_version:1.0.0
dragonfly_git_sha1:0a1b2c3d
dragonfly_mode:standalone
...
```

To set a key, use the following command:

```
SET mykey mykeyvalue123
```

This should return a confirmation `OK`.

To retrieve the set key value, use:

```
GET mykey
```

The output will be the value of the key, in this case,
`"mykeyvalue123"`.

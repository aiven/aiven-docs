[Apache Cassandra®](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) is an open source, NoSQL database. It is specifically designed to be highly available, performant, and scalable. It supports a distributed architecture with asynchronous replication and is highly fault tolerant.

Apache Cassandra originated from Facebook, and since then has had a
strong history with some of the most demanding data platforms around
while being in the care of the Apache project. From this strong history
comes a robust database with an emphasis on security, and the ability to
scale up to meet the needs of even the largest data platforms.

Aiven for Apache Cassandra builds on the open source offering, adding
management features and updates so that you can rely on the database
your organisation needs to succeed.

Apache Cassandra® is designed to handle large volumes of writes to the
database; this is one of the key reasons we see for adopting Apache
Cassandra over other options in a similar problem space.

It is a truly distributed database where the individual nodes can
communicate with one another without referencing any master node. This
improves both its scalability and its fault tolerance, two key
capabilities of Apache Cassandra.

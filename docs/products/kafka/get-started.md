Aiven services are managed in the Aiven [web console](https://console.aiven.io/). When you first log in to the console with your email address and password, you will see the **Services** view, which shows you all the services in the currently selected project.

Aiven for Apache Kafka® is a managed service offered by Aiven. The first
step in using Aiven for Apache Kafka® is to create a service. You can do
so using the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) or the
[Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli).

## Create an Aiven for Apache Kafka® service

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

2.  Follow
    [these instructions](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service) to create an Aiven for Apache Kafka service.

    Once the service is ready, the status changes to *Running*.
    Depending on your selected cloud provider and region, this generally
    takes a couple of minutes.

title: Consumer lag predictor for Aiven for Apache Kafka®
sidebar_label: Consumer lag predictor

---

The **consumer lag predictor** for Aiven for Apache Kafka estimates the
delay between the time a message is produced and when it's eventually
consumed by a consumer group. This information can be used to improve
the performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of your Kafka
cluster.

To use the **consumer lag predictor** effectively, set up
[Prometheus integration](/docs/platform/howto/integrations/prometheus-metrics) with your
Aiven for Apache Kafka® service. The Prometheus
integration enables the extraction of key metrics necessary for lag
prediction and monitoring.

## Why use consumer lag predictor?

By periodically analyzing the Kafka cluster, including topic and
consumer group offsets, this *Consumer Lag Predictor* provides insights
crucial for scenarios like auto-scaling consumers, ensuring timely
message processing.

### Use case

-   **Auto-scaling of consumers**: Leveraging the time lag metric allows
    users to optimize message processing by dynamically adapting their
    consumers.

## Limitation

Using the **consumer lag predictor** can impact your Apache Kafka
cluster's performance. While it offers valuable insights, it also
demands more CPU and memory on each Kafka node. To optimize its use,
consider the following:

-   **Resource management:** Enabling the *Consumer Lag Predictor* will
    lead to higher CPU and memory consumption on each Kafka node. Before
    enabling it, review your current resource usage to ensure smooth
    performance.
-   **Topic selection:** It is advisable to be selective when choosing
    topics for lag calculation. Starting with a few topics and gradually
    including more can effectively manage system performance impact.

## Metrics

Metrics offer a tangible way to measure and understand consumer lag.
These metrics can be viewed and analyzed using monitoring tools like
Prometheus. Here are the key metrics provided:

-   `kafka_lag_predictor_topic_produced_records`: Represents the number
    of records produced, categorized by topic and partition.
-   `kafka_lag_predictor_group_consumed_records`: Represents the number
    of records consumed, sorted by group, topic, and partition.
-   `kafka_lag_predictor_group_lag_predicted_seconds`: Provides the
    predicted lag time in seconds, organized by group, topic, and
    partition.

title: NOT_LEADER_FOR_PARTITION errors
---

Aiven continuously monitors services to ensure they are healthy. If problems arise, nodes can be recycled: new nodes are created to substitute old, malfunctioning ones.
During nodes replacement in your Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ® cluster, you may find several `NOT_LEADER_FOR_PARTITION` warnings or errors in the logs of your producer.

The exact error message depends on your client library and log
formatting, but should be similar to the following:

```text
[2021-02-04 09:01:20,118] WARN [Producer clientId=test-producer] Received invalid metadata error in produce request on partition topic1-25 due to org.apache.kafka.common.errors.NotLeaderForPartitionException: This server is not the leader for that topic-partition.. Going to request metadata update now (org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender)
```

This is an expected behavior as part of the failover from old to new
nodes.

Each producer contains a metadata cache that identifies which broker is
the leader of each partition. When your code produces a message, it
tries to send it to the broker that is the partition leader according to
the producer's metadata cache.

When nodes are replaced, the partition leaders are expected to change.
Every partition leader changes at least once, but it can be more,
depending on the number of nodes and how many nodes are replaced at a
time.

:::note
If a service has 3000 active partitions, then you can expect at least
one of these error messages for each partition in each producer.
:::

Most producers libraries update their cluster metadata cache on a
regular poll interval, or immediately based on errors. After that, they
continue producing messages without issue. However, high load on the
broker side or unfortunate timing in parallel requests can sometimes
trigger several updates. This might cause a very large number of these
warnings in the producer logs, which can look worrying but is in fact
harmless.

title: Trade-offs and limitations
early: true

The main trade-off of tiered storage is the higher latency while
accessing and reading data from remote storage compared to local disk
storage. While adding local caching can partially solve this problem, it
cannot eliminate the latency completely.

## Limitations

-   Tiered storage currently does not support compacted topics.
-   If you enable tiered storage for a topic, you cannot deactivate it
    without losing data in the remote storage. To deactivate tiered
    storage, contact [Aiven support](mailto:support@aiven.io).
-   Increasing the local retention threshold won\'t move segments
    already uploaded to remote storage back to local storage. This
    change only affects new data segments.
-   If you enable tiered storage on a service, you can\'t migrate the
    service to a different region or cloud, except for moving to a
    virtual cloud in the same region. For migration to a different
    region or cloud, contact [Aiven support](mailto:support@aiven.io).

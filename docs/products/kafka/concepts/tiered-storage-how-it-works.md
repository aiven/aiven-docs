title: How tiered storage works in Aiven for Apache Kafka速
early: true

Aiven for Apache Kafka速 tiered storage is a feature that optimizes data
management across two distinct storage tiers:

-   **Local tier**: Primarily consists of faster and typically more
    expensive storage solutions like solid-state drives (SSDs).
-   **Remote tier**: Relies on slower, cost-effective options like cloud
    object storage.

In Aiven for Apache Kafka's tiered storage architecture, **remote
storage** refers to storage options external to the Kafka broker's
local disk. This typically includes cloud-based or self-hosted object
storage solutions like AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage. Although
network-attached block storage solutions like AWS EBS are technically
external to the Kafka broker, Apache Kafka considers them local storage
within its tiered storage architecture.

Tiered storage operates in a way that is seamless for both Apache Kafka
producers and consumers. This means that producers and consumers
interact with Apache Kafka in the same way, regardless of whether tiered
storage is enabled or not.

Administrators can configure tiered storage per topic by defining the
retention period and retention bytes to specify how much data should be
retained on the local disk instead of remote storage.

## Local vs. remote data retention

When tiered storage is enabled, data produced to a topic is initially
stored on the local disk of the Kafka broker. Data is then
asynchronously transferred to remote storage based on the pre-defined
local retention threshold. During periods of high data ingestion or
transient errors, such as network connectivity issues, the local storage
might temporarily hold more data than specified by the local retention
threshold.

## Segment management

Data is organized into segments, which are uploaded to remote storage
individually. The active (newest) segment remains in local storage,
which means that the segment size can also influence local data
retention. For instance, if the local retention threshold is 1 GB, but
the segment size is 2 GB, the local storage will exceed the 1 GB limit
until the active segment is rolled over and uploaded to remote storage.

## Asynchronous uploads and replication

Data is transferred to remote storage asynchronously and does not
interfere with the producer activity. While the Kafka broker aims to
move data as swiftly as possible, certain conditions, such as high
ingestion rate or connectivity issues, may cause more data to be stored
in the local storage than the specified local retention policy.

Any data exceeding the local retention threshold will not be purged by
the log cleaner until it is successfully uploaded to remote storage. The
replication factor is not considered during the upload process, and only
one copy of each segment is uploaded to the remote storage. Most remote
storage options have their own measures, including data replication, to
ensure data durability.

## Data retrieval

When consumers fetch records stored in remote storage, the Kafka broker
downloads and caches these records locally. This allows for quicker
access in subsequent retrieval operations.

Aiven allocates a small amount of disk space, ranging from 2GB to 16GB,
equivalent to 5% of the Kafka broker's total available disk, for the
temporary storage of fetched records.

## Security

Segments are encrypted with 256-bit AES encryption before being uploaded
to the remote storage. The encryption keys are not shared with the cloud
storage provider and generally do not leave Aiven management machines
and the Kafka brokers.

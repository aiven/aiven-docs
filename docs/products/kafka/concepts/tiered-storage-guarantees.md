With Aiven for Apache Kafka速's tiered storage, there are two primary
types of data retention guarantees: *total retention* and *local
retention*.

**Total retention**: Tiered storage ensures that your data will be
available up to the limit defined by the total retention threshold,
regardless of whether it is stored locally or remotely. This means that
your data will not be deleted until the total retention threshold,
whether on local or remote storage, is reached.

**Local retention**: Log segments are only removed from local storage
after successfully being uploaded to remote storage, even if the data
exceeds the local retention threshold.

## Example

Let's say you have a topic with a **total retention threshold** of
**1000 GB** and a **local retention threshold** of **200 GB**. This
means that:

-   All data for the topic will be retained, regardless of whether it is
    stored locally or remotely, as long as the total size of the data
    does not exceed 1000 GB.
-   If tiered storage is enabled per topic, older segments will be
    uploaded immediately to remote storage, irrespective of whether the
    local retention threshold of 200 GB is exceeded. Data will be
    deleted from local storage only after it has been safely transferred
    to remote storage.
-   If the total size of the data exceeds 1000 GB, Apache Kafka will
    begin deleting the oldest data from remote storage.

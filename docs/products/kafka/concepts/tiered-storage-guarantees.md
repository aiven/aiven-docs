title: Guarantees
---

With Aiven for Apache Kafka速's tiered storage, there are two primary
types of data retention guarantees: *total retention* and *local
retention*.

**Total retention**: Tiered storage ensures that your data remains available up to the
limit defined by the total retention threshold, whether stored locally or remotely.
This means your data is not deleted until reaching the total retention threshold,
regardless of storage location.

**Local retention**: Log segments are only removed from local storage
after successfully being uploaded to remote storage, even if the data
exceeds the local retention threshold.

## Example

Let's say you have a topic with a **total retention threshold** of
**1000 GB** and a **local retention threshold** of **200 GB**. This
means that:

- All data for the topic is retained, regardless of whether it is stored locally or
  remotely, as long as the total size of the data does not exceed 1000 GB.
- If tiered storage is enabled per topic, older segments are
  uploaded immediately to remote storage, irrespective of whether the
  local retention threshold of 200 GB is exceeded. Data is deleted from local storage
  only after it has been safely transferred
  to remote storage.
- If the total size of the data exceeds 1000 GB, Apache Kafka begins deleting the
  oldest data from remote storage.

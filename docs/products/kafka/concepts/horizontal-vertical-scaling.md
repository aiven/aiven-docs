title: Scaling options in Apache Kafka®
---

Aiven for Apache Kafka® has a number of predefined plans that specify
the number of brokers and the capacity of individual brokers. The
predefined plans consist of 3, 6, 9, 15, or 30 brokers, but we can also
create larger custom plans based on customer requirements.

To increase the capacity of an existing Kafka cluster, two options are
available:

-   **Vertical** scaling the performance of individual brokers
-   **Horizontal** scaling the cluster by adding more brokers

Both scaling options are available for all Aiven for Apache Kafka
customers and don't require any downtime, keeping your cluster up and
running during the upgrade.

:::note
When you change the service plan, Aiven automatically starts adding new
brokers with the new specifications to your existing cluster. Once the
new brokers are online and the data is replicated to them from the older
nodes, the old brokers are retired one by one.
:::

Aiven recommends to use both the vertical and horizontal scaling
capabilities of Aiven for Apache Kafka to achieve the best possible
performance and fault tolerance.

:::tip
For production clusters, Aiven advises a minimum of 6 cluster nodes to
avoid situations when a failure in a single cluster node causes a sharp
increase in load for the remaining nodes.

## Vertical scaling

Scaling vertically a Kafka cluster means keeping the same number of
brokers but replacing existing nodes with higher capacity nodes. If you
cannot increase the partition or topic count of your Kafka cluster due
to application constraints, this is usually the only available option.

An example of vertical scaling is when changing the service plan from
**Aiven for Apache Kafka Business-4** to **Aiven for Apache Kafka
Business-8**. For such case Aiven immediately launches three new brokers
with the increased capacity defined by the **Business-8** plan,
transfers the data in the new nodes, and once the data is replicated
retires the old brokers.

## Horizontal scaling

Scaling horizontally means adding more brokers to an existing Kafka
cluster. This allows sharing the load in the cluster between a larger
number of individual nodes, allowing the cluster to serve more requests
as a whole.

:::note
Scaling horizontally also makes the cluster more resilient to a failure
of a single node: if one broker in a 3-node cluster fails, the remaining
two nodes get a 50% load increase, which may cause availability issues
in the cluster. If one broker in a 9-node cluster fails, the remaining 8
nodes will only see a load increase of roughly 13%.
:::

An example of horizontal scaling is changing the service from the 3-node
**Aiven for Apache Kafka Business-8** plan to the 6-node *Aiven for
Apache Kafka Premium-6x-8* plan. For such case, Aiven immediately
launches six new brokers adding them to the existing cluster. The
existing cluster nodes stay online, and once the new brokers are online
and included in the cluster configuration, Kafka starts placing
partition replicas on them. Once all the data is copied to the new
brokers the old nodes are removed.

:::warning
Depending on the data volumes, it may take some time until the Apache
Kafka cluster is fully balanced.

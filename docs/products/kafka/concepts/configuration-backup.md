Aiven for Apache Kafka速 includes **configuration backups** that automatically back up key service configurations at no additional cost.

By eliminating the need for manual reconfiguration, Aiven for Apache Kafka速 configuration
backups streamline disaster recovery and service restoration. This ensures a reliable
way to restore your service configurations after an incident or when powering off/on your
service, saving you valuable time and resources.

## What is backed up

Configuration backups cover the following components of your Aiven for Apache
Kafka service:

- **Apache Kafka topics configurations**: Including related configuration parameters such
  as retention time and number of partitions.
- **Apache Kafka users and ACLs**: User permissions and access control lists are included.
- **Schema Registry data**: Including schema definitions, schema IDs, configurations
  (such as compatibility level), subjects, and subject versions.
- **Apache Kafka Connect configurations**: Includes all related settings.

## How backups work

- **Automatic backups**: Backups are enabled by default and stored in cloud storage
  every 3 hours.
- **Encryption**: Backups are encrypted for security, preventing direct access by
  users.
- **Automatic restoration and configuration retention**: Configuration backups are
  automatically restored (using the latest backup) after a power off/on cycle. This
  ensures your service configurations are retained and ready for use.

## Limitations

While configuration backups offer significant benefits, there are some limitations:

- **No data backups**: Configuration backups do not include the actual data stored in
  topics, consumer groups, and their offsets. Only the cluster configurations are
  backed up.
- **Latest backup restoration**: Restoration is always from the latest backup available.
  You cannot choose a specific backup for restoration.

title: Apache Kafka速 REST API
---

[Karapace](https://github.com/aiven/karapace) provides a RESTful interface to your Apache Kafka速 cluster, allowing you to produce and consume messages and perform administrative cluster work.

Authorization can be enabled for Apache Kafka速 REST APIs using Apache
Kafka速 REST proxy authorization. The authorization rules are based on
[Kafka ACLs](/docs/products/kafka/concepts/acl). For information, see
[Apache Kafka REST proxy authorization](/docs/products/kafka/karapace/concepts/kafka-rest-proxy-authorization).

title: Troubleshoot Apache Kafka® consumer connections
---

Apache Kafka® consumers sometimes experience disconnections from a
cluster node. On one hand, isolated occurrences are expected and well
mitigated by the Apache Kafka® protocol, for example in case a partition
leadership moved to a different node so the cluster remains available
and balanced. On the other hand, repeating occurrences often raise
concerns as they may impact consumer lag, and cluster performance. This
article provides guidance to better identify and solve related issues.

## What is observed

The client behaviour may vary depending on the library and version
(remind to keep it up-to-date) in use. A typical consumer disconnection
log is as follows:
`[AdminClient] Node 3 disconnected. (org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient:937)`.

On the server, the GroupCoordinator undertakes some consumer-group
re-balancing activity, as for example:
`Member ABC has left group my-app through explicit LeaveGroup; client reason: the consumer unsubscribed from all topics (kafka.coordinator.group.GroupCoordinator)`
or `Timed out HeartbeatRequest`.

## What it means

As they are processing messages, consumer instances may break, fail to
request more local resources or to complete their current task on time.
In this case, they leave their group either explicitly or by missing to
send a heartbeat to the cluster.

As a consequence, the partition assignments of the consumer leaving the
group are automatically re-affected to other consumers of the group, if
they exist.

## Why it occurs now and never before

-   The consumer of a given topic `A` can get dropped because it relies
    on the same `group.id` as another consumer leaving or joining the
    group, even if the later consumes a totally different topic `B`. Any
    rebalance triggered by any one consumer would still affect the other
    consumers in the group.
-   Although consumer heartbeat and message processing are to be
    executed by 2 different client threads, the machine (on which the
    consumer application runs) can get overloaded and so it cannot send
    a heartbeat to the group coordinator after `heartbeat.interval.ms`
    (default: 3s) and before `session.timeout.ms` (default: 45s).
-   If the consumer logic consists in expensive transformations or
    synchronous API calls, then your average single message processing
    time can dramatically increase, as in the following example
    scenarios:
    -   The subsystem it depends on has an issue (ex. the destination
        server is not available).
    -   The incoming message size increased.
-   If the consumer lag has grown enough so that the consumer now
    processes `max.poll.records` (default: 500), then your average batch
    processing time and resources can dramatically increase, with the
    following consequences:
    -   The consumer may run out-of-memory, resulting in an application
        crash.
    -   The `max.poll.interval.ms` is exceeded between polls, so the
        consumer sends a LeaveGroup-request to the coordinator rather
        than sending a heartbeat.

## How to solve it

-   Make sure that your consumers are relying on a unique `group.id`.
-   It is generally a good idea to reduce `max.poll.records` or
    `max.partition.fetch.bytes`, and then monitor if the situation
    improves.
-   If it is required to stick to large batches (such as in windowing
    and data lake ingestion use-cases), then temporarily increasing
    `session.timeout.ms` might do the trick.
-   Remind that `session.timeout.ms` must be in the allowable range as
    configured in the broker configuration by
    `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`.
-   It is recommended to configure `heartbeat.interval.ms` to be no more
    than a third of `session.timeout.ms`. This ensures that even if a
    heartbeat or two are lost over the transient network, then the
    consumer is still considered alive.
-   If the problem arose because of an increase in the volume of
    incoming messages, then we would advise to scale the consumer
    up/vertically or out/horizontally.

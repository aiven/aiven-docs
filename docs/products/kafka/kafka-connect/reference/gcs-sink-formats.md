The Apache Kafka Connect® GCS sink connector by Aiven enables you to
move data from an Aiven for Apache Kafka® cluster to a Google Cloud
Storage bucket for long term storage. The full connector documentation
is available in the dedicated [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-kafka-connect-gcs).

## File name format

The connector uses the following format for output files (blobs)

```
<prefix><topic>-<partition>-<start-offset>[.gz]
```

The file name format has the following building blocks:

-   `<prefix>`: the file name prefix, useful, for example, to define
    subdirectories in the storage bucket
-   `<topic>`: the source Apache Kafka topic name
-   `<partition>`: the source Apache Kafka topic's partition number
-   `<start-offset>`: the offset of the first record in the file
-   `[.gz]`: the file suffix, added when compression is enabled and
    depending on compression type

## Data format

The connector output files are text files that contain one record per
line (separated by `\n`).

There are two types of data format available:

-   **Flat structure**: it's the default data format, where the field
    values are separated by comma (CSV).

    You can use the CSV format by setting the `format.output.type` to
    `csv`.

-   **Complex structure**: the file stores messages in the format of
    JSON lines. It contains one record per line and each line is a valid
    JSON object (`jsonl`).

    You can use the JSON format by setting the `format.output.type` to
    `jsonl`.

title: Causes of "connector list not currently available"
---

Sometimes, when accessing the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/)
and trying to view the list of connectors in your Aiven for Apache
KafkaÂ® Connect cluster you can encounter the message
`connector list not currently available`.

:::note
The same error message is shown in Terraform (for example, when using
`terraform plan`) because it uses the same backend API.
:::

There can be a number of reasons why you are seeing the above message:

-   The dedicated Apache Kafka Connect cluster was just created. The
    list will load after the cluster is fully online with all the nodes
    in running state
-   The Apache Kafka Connect API on a Kafka cluster was just enabled. It
    should take a few seconds for the Apache Kafka Connect services to
    be operational
-   The Apache Kafka Connect cluster is in the process of setting
    up/reconfiguring a connector. This message should clear after a few
    seconds
-   The Apache Kafka Connect cluster is running out of memory. You will
    likely keep seeing this message unless you upgrade to a larger plan
-   One or more nodes on the Apache Kafka Connect cluster crashed. The
    API that fetches the connector list calls the Apache Kafka Connect
    cluster by it's hostname and that maps to one of the 3 workers
    randomly. If you see this message appear intermittently, this is
    likely the reason. The crashed node should recover automatically,
    but if it doesn't, please [contact our
    support](https://aiven.io/support-services) for further help

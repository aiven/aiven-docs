title: Request a new connector
---

If you know about new and interesting Apache KafkaÂ® connectors you'd
like us to support, email us at [support@aiven.io](mailto:support@aiven.io).
We will evaluate the requested connector and might add support for it.

Aiven's evaluation process for new Apache Kafka Connect connectors
checks:

-   license compatibility
-   technical implementation
-   active repository maintenance

:::tip
When requesting connectors that are not on the pre-approved list through
a support ticket, specify the target Aiven for Apache Kafka service
you'd like to have it installed to.

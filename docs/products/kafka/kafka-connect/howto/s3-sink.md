title: Amazon S3 sink
---

Use the Amazon S3 sink connectors to move data from Apache KafkaÂ® topics to Amazon S3 for storage and analytics.

Before you create a connector, complete the setup steps in
[Prepare AWS for S3 sink](docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/s3-sink-prereq).

You can then choose one of the following connectors:

- [Amazon S3 sink connector (Aiven)](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/s3-sink-connector-aiven)
- [Amazon S3 sink connector (Confluent)](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/s3-sink-connector-confluent)

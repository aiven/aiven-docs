Multi-version connector support lets you control which connector version is used in your Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect速 service.
It prevents compatibility issues from automatic updates, avoids breaking changes
when multiple dependencies rely on a specific connector version, and allows testing,
upgrading, or reverting versions to maintain production pipeline stability.

### Key considerations for multi-version connectors

- Deprecated connector versions may be removed during maintenance updates. If you
  [pin](#pin-version) a deprecated version, the system alerts you, highlights any
  known breaking changes, and recommends an upgrade. Upgrade to a supported version to
  avoid compatibility issues, as support is typically limited to the most recent versions.
- Pinning a connector version applies to the entire plugin, ensuring that all
  connectors provided by the plugin (such as source and sink connectors) use the same
  version.
- Multi-version support is available only for connectors with multiple published
  versions. Support for additional connectors expands as new versions are released.
- If no version is pinned, the latest available version is used.
- Refer to [Check available connector versions](#check-available-connector-versions) to
  confirm which versions are supported before pinning a version.

## Prerequisites

- [Aiven for Apache Kafka速 service](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/enable-connect)
  with a [dedicated Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect速 service](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/get-started#apache_kafka_connect_dedicated_cluster)
  enabled
- [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli)
- [Aiven API](/docs/tools/api)
- [Aiven Provider for Terraform](/docs/tools/terraform)

:::note
Multi-version support is only available for **dedicated Kafka Connect services**. Ensure
that your service is updated to enable this feature.

## Check available connector versions {#check-available-connector-versions}

Before pinning a connector version, confirm which versions are available for your
Apache Kafka Connect service. Use one of the following methods:

<Tabs groupId="check-method">

<TabItem value="api" label="Aiven API" default>

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/<project_name>/service/<service_name>/available-connectors" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
   ```

1. Review the response to see the available versions. If multiple versions are listed,
   the connector supports multi-versioning.

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
    "plugin_name": "aiven-kafka-connect-jdbc",
    "available_versions": [
        {
            "version": "6.10.0",
            "deprecated": false
        },
        {
            "version": "6.9.0",
            "deprecated": true
        }
    ]
   }
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Aiven CLI">

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   avn service connector available <service_name>
   ```

1. Review the output to see the available versions. If multiple versions are listed,
   the connector supports multi-versioning.

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
      "plugin_name": "aiven-kafka-connect-jdbc",
      "available_versions": [
        {
          "version": "6.10.0",
          "deprecated": false
        },
        {
          "version": "6.9.0",
          "deprecated": true
        }
      ]
    }
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="terraform" label="Terraform">

In Terraform, you can directly specify the desired connector version by using
the `plugin_versions` attribute in your configuration. This ensures that your
Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect service uses the exact version you require.

Refer to the [Pin a connector version](#pin-version) section for detailed steps and
examples.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pin a connector version {#pin-version}

To use a specific connector version, update the `plugin_versions` property in the
service configuration. Pinning a **plugin version** applies to all connectors
(source and sink) provided by that plugin. For example, pinning
the `aiven-kafka-connect-jdbc` plugin to version `6.9.0` affects both the JDBC source
and sink connectors.

:::note
Pinning a plugin version restarts Apache Kafka Connect and reloads all plugins.
Allow time for the process to complete.

<Tabs groupId="setup-method">
<TabItem value="api" label="Aiven API" default>

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -X PUT "https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/<project_name>/service/<service_name>" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token>" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
         "plugin_versions": {
           "<plugin_name>": "<version>"

Multi-version connector support lets you control which connector version is used in your Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect速 service.
It prevents compatibility issues from automatic updates, avoids breaking changes
when multiple dependencies rely on a specific connector version, and allows testing,
upgrading, or reverting versions to maintain production pipeline stability. You can
specify the version of a connector by setting the `plugin_versions` property in the
service configuration.

## Key considerations for multi-version connectors

- Deprecated connector versions may be removed during maintenance updates. If you
  [set](#set-version) a deprecated version, the system alerts you and recommends an
  upgrade. The connector will continue to run, but upgrading to a supported version is
  recommended to avoid compatibility issues.
- Support is limited to the latest connector version and the most recent previous
  version. Breaking changes, if known, are mentioned in
  [maintenance update notifications](/docs/platform/concepts/maintenance-window#maintenance-updates).
- Setting a connector version applies to the entire plugin, ensuring that all
  connectors provided by the plugin (such as source and sink connectors) use the same
  version.
- Multi-version support is available for all connectors where Aiven has published and
  supports more than one version. Support will continue to expand as new versions are
  released.
- Set a specific version to prevent automatic upgrades. If not set, the latest published
  version is used.
- See [Check available connector versions](#check-available-connector-versions) to
  confirm which versions are supported before setting a version.

:::warning
Breaking changes may exist between different connector versions. These changes often
involve updates to configuration parameters, such as the removal of deprecated parameters
or the introduction of new ones.
Before upgrading:
- Review the connector release notes for details on changes.
- Always test a connector version change in a non-production environment before applying it
in production.
:::

:::note
Aiven supports multiple Debezium versions through multi-version support, including
versions 1.9.7, 2.5.0, 2.7.4, and 3.1.0.

To prevent automatic upgrades during maintenance, pin the connector version using
the `plugin_versions` property.

If you use Debezium for PostgreSQL with version 1.9.7 and the `wal2json` format, do not
upgrade to version 2.0 or later until you migrate to `pgoutput`.

For upgrade steps, see [Set a connector version](#set-version).

## Limitations

Connector version selection is available in the Aiven Console only
for [dedicated Apache Kafka Connect services](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/get-started#apache_kafka_connect_dedicated_cluster).

If you enabled [Apache Kafka Connect](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/enable-connect)
as part of an Aiven for Apache Kafka service, use the [Aiven API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/),
[Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli), or
[Aiven Provider for Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs)
to set the connector version.


## Prerequisites

- [Aiven for Apache Kafka速 service](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/enable-connect)
  with a [dedicated Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect速 service](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/get-started#apache_kafka_connect_dedicated_cluster)
  enabled
- [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli)
- [Aiven API](/docs/tools/api)
- [Aiven Provider for Terraform](/docs/tools/terraform)


## Check available connector versions {#check-available-connector-versions}

Before selecting a connector version, check which versions are available for your
Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect service. This ensures that the desired version is
supported and can be set if needed. Use one of the following methods:

<Tabs groupId="check-method">
<TabItem value="console" label="Aiven Console" default>

1. Access the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
1. Select your Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect service.
1. Click <ConsoleLabel name="Connectors"/>.

Connectors that support multiple versions display **2 versions** next to their names on
the **Connectors** page.

:::note
When setting up a new connector, a default version is selected. To change it, go to the
connector details page and click **Change version**.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="Aiven API" default>

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/<project_name>/service/<service_name>/available-connectors" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
   ```

1. Review the response to see the available versions. If multiple versions are listed,
   the connector supports multi-versioning.

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
    "plugin_name": "aiven-kafka-connect-jdbc",
    "available_versions": [
        {
            "version": "6.10.0",
            "deprecated": false
        },
        {
            "version": "6.9.0",
            "deprecated": true
        }
    ]
   }
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Aiven CLI">

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   avn service connector available <service_name>
   ```

1. Review the output to see the available versions. If multiple versions are listed,
   the connector supports multi-versioning.

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
      "plugin_name": "aiven-kafka-connect-jdbc",
      "available_versions": [
        {
          "version": "6.10.0",
          "deprecated": false
        },
        {
          "version": "6.9.0",
          "deprecated": true
        }
      ]
    }
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Set a connector version {#set-version}

To set a specific connector version, update the `plugin_versions` property in the
service configuration using the API, CLI, or Terraform. In the Aiven Console, you can
select the version through the UI.

The selected version applies to all instances of the connector, including both source and
sink connectors. For example, setting
the `aiven-kafka-connect-jdbc` plugin to version `6.9.0` affects both the JDBC source
and sink connectors.

:::note
Changing the connector version restarts the Apache Kafka Connect service and reloads
all plugins. This process can take several minutes.
:::

<Tabs groupId="check-method">
<TabItem value="console" label="Aiven Console" default>

:::note
Connector version selection in the Aiven Console is available only for
[dedicated Apache Kafka Connect services](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/get-started#apache_kafka_connect_dedicated_cluster).
:::

1. In your Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect service, click <ConsoleLabel name="Connectors"/>.
1. In the **Enabled connectors** section, locate the connector to update.
1. Click <ConsoleLabel name="actions"/> > **Change connector version**.
1. In the **Version setup** window:
   - Select the version to use.
   - Optional: If you select the latest version, you can turn on
     **Enable version updates** to automatically update the connector to newer
     versions during maintenance updates.

     :::note
     **Enable version updates** is available only for the latest (default) version. This
     option is unavailable for older versions because automatic updates apply only to the latest version.
     :::
1. Depending on your selection, click:
   - **Install version and restart service** to apply the selected version.
   - **Confirm version** to keep the current version.

:::note
If you change the version, the connector installs the new package and restarts. The
selected version applies to all instances of the connector, including both source and
sink connectors.

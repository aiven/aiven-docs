Multi-version connector support lets you control which connector version is used in your Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect速 service.
It prevents compatibility issues from automatic updates, avoids breaking changes
when multiple dependencies rely on a specific connector version, and allows testing,
upgrading, or reverting versions to maintain production pipeline stability. You can
specify the version of a connector by setting the `plugin_versions` property in the
service configuration.

## Key considerations for multi-version connectors

- Deprecated connector versions may be removed during maintenance updates. If you
  [pin](#pin-version) a deprecated version, the system alerts you and recommends an
  upgrade. The connector will continue to run, but upgrading to a supported version is
  recommended to avoid compatibility issues.
- Support is limited to the latest connector version and the most recent previous
  version. Breaking changes, if any, are detailed in
  [maintenance update notifications](/docs/platform/concepts/maintenance-window#maintenance-updates).
- Pinning a connector version applies to the entire plugin, ensuring that all
  connectors provided by the plugin (such as source and sink connectors) use the same
  version.
- Multi-version support is available for all connectors where Aiven has published and
  supports more than one version. Support will continue to expand as new versions are
  released.
- If no version is pinned, the latest available version is used.
- Refer to [Check available connector versions](#check-available-connector-versions) to
  confirm which versions are supported before pinning a version.

## Supported connectors and versions

:::note
All versions listed in the table are supported unless explicitly noted otherwise.
:::


| Connector          | Versions              |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Debezium            | `2.5.0` (recommended) <br /> `1.9.7` (deprecated) |
| JDBC                | `6.10.0` (recommended) <br /> `6.9.0` (deprecated) |
| Snowflake           | `2.3.0` (recommended) <br /> `2.2.0`               |


:::tip
This is a partial list of connectors, and it may change as new versions are released. To
view the most up-to-date versions, see
[Check available connector versions](#check-available-connector-versions).
:::

:::note
If you are using version `1.9.7` of the Debezium connector, you can upgrade to
version `2.5.0` without raising a support ticket. To upgrade, pin version `2.5.0` in
your configuration. For details, see [Pin a connector version](#pin-version).

## Prerequisites

- [Aiven for Apache Kafka速 service](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/enable-connect)
  with a [dedicated Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect速 service](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/get-started#apache_kafka_connect_dedicated_cluster)
  enabled
- [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli)
- [Aiven API](/docs/tools/api)

:::note
Multi-version support is only available for **dedicated Kafka Connect services**. Ensure
that your service is updated to enable this feature.

## Check available connector versions {#check-available-connector-versions}

Before pinning a connector version, check which versions are available for your
Apache Kafka Connect service. Verify if a connector supports multi-versioning by
reviewing the listed versions. Use one of the following methods:

<Tabs groupId="check-method">

<TabItem value="api" label="Aiven API" default>

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/<project_name>/service/<service_name>/available-connectors" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
   ```

1. Review the response to see the available versions. If multiple versions are listed,
   the connector supports multi-versioning.

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
    "plugin_name": "aiven-kafka-connect-jdbc",
    "available_versions": [
        {
            "version": "6.10.0",
            "deprecated": false
        },
        {
            "version": "6.9.0",
            "deprecated": true
        }
    ]
   }
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Aiven CLI">

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   avn service connector available <service_name>
   ```

1. Review the output to see the available versions. If multiple versions are listed,
   the connector supports multi-versioning.

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
      "plugin_name": "aiven-kafka-connect-jdbc",
      "available_versions": [
        {
          "version": "6.10.0",
          "deprecated": false
        },
        {
          "version": "6.9.0",
          "deprecated": true
        }
      ]
    }
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="terraform" label="Terraform">

In Terraform, you can specify the desired connector version using the `plugin_versions`
attribute in your configuration. This ensures that your Apache Kafka Connect service
uses the exact version you need.

For detailed steps and examples, see [Pin a connector version](#pin-version).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pin a connector version {#pin-version}

To use a specific connector version, update the `plugin_versions` property in the
service configuration. Pinning a **plugin version** applies to all connectors
(source and sink) provided by that plugin. For example, pinning
the `aiven-kafka-connect-jdbc` plugin to version `6.9.0` affects both the JDBC source
and sink connectors.

:::note
Pinning a plugin version restarts Apache Kafka Connect and reloads all plugins.
Allow time for the process to complete.

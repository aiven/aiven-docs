title: Use AWS IAM assume role credentials provider
---

The
[Apache Kafka® S3 sink connector by Aiven](s3-sink-connector-aiven) allows you to move data from an Aiven for Apache Kafka®
cluster to Amazon S3 for long term storage. The connection between the
connector and the S3 bucket can be managed either via long-term AWS
credentials (`ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), or using [AWS
Assume role
credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-assume-role-credentials.html)
which request a short-term credential every time the connector has a
task to store data to an S3 bucket.

To use AWS Assume role credentials in the S3 sink connector, you need
to:

-   Request a unique IAM user from Aiven support
-   Create an AWS cross-account access role
-   Create an Kafka Connect S3 Sink connector

## Request a unique IAM user from Aiven support

Every customer in Aiven has a dedicated IAM user. Therefore, there are
no shared credentials and roles among customers, and a [cross-account
role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html)
provides access to one Aiven project only. You can request an IAM user
and the [External
ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html)
(the role unique identifier) by contacting the Aiven support at
`support@aiven.io`.

The following is a sample IAM user and External ID:

-   IAM user: `arn:aws:iam::012345678901:user/sample-project-user`
-   External ID: `2f401145-06a0-4938-8e05-2d67196a0695`

## Create an AWS cross-account access role

To create a cross-account access role:

1.  Log in to the AWS Console and go to **IAM** > **Roles** >
    **Create role**

2.  Select **Another AWS account** as a type of trusted entity

3.  Specify the **Account ID**

    :::note
    The **Account ID** is the numerical string contained in the IAM user
    between `aws:iam::` and `:user/`.

    In the above example, it is `012345678901`.
    :::

4.  Select an option **Require external ID** and paste the External ID

5.  Select permissions that allow writing to an S3 bucket. The following
    permissions are needed:

    -   `s3:GetObject`
    -   `s3:PutObject`
    -   `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`
    -   `s3:ListMultipartUploadParts`
    -   `s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads`

6.  Optionally, add tags

7.  Specify a name for the role. As an example, `AivenKafkaConnectSink`

8.  To further secure the setting and limit access, you associate the
    newly created role to a unique full **IAM user** name.

    You can do so, by editing the newly created role
    (`AivenKafkaConnectSink`) and go to **Trust relationships** > **Edit trust relationship**

9.  In a policy document, the **IAM user** should be specified as
    `Principal`.

10. Copy the newly created **IAM role ARN**. It will be needed in the
    Kafka Connector configuration.

## Create a Kafka Connect S3 Sink connector

You can view all the necessary steps to create an S3 sink connector in
the
[dedicated documentation](s3-sink-connector-aiven). To use the IAM assume role credentials provider, you simply
need to remove, in the connector configuration, the references to:

-   `aws.access.key.id`
-   `aws.secret.access.key`

And substitute them with

-   `aws.sts.role.arn`: the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for IAM role
    created in the previous step
-   `aws.sts.role.external.id`: the role IAM user External Id provided
    by the Aiven support team

You can also include the following parameters:

-   `aws.sts.role.session.name`: the id of the session used to identify
    the task. Can be used to separate different tasks from the same
    project, and it will be visible in AWS Could Trail log
-   `aws.sts.config.endpoint`: the Security Token Service (STS)
    endpoint. Choosing an endpoint close to the s3 bucket location is
    likely going to provide better performances. As example, if the S3
    bucket is in the AWS region `eu-north-1`, the STS endpoint shoud be
    set to `https://sts.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com`. You can review the
    list of STS endpoints in the [dedicated AWS
    documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html).

The connector configurations in a file (we'll refer to it with the name
`s3_sink.json`) should contain at least the following content:

```json
{
    "name": "<CONNECTOR_NAME>",
    "connector.class": "io.aiven.kafka.connect.s3.AivenKafkaConnectS3SinkConnector",
    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter",
    "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter",
    "topics": "<TOPIC_NAME>",
    "aws.sts.role.arn": "<AWS_ROLE_ARN>",
    "aws.sts.role.external.id": "<AWS_IAM_USER_EXTERNAL_ID>",
    "aws.sts.role.session.name":"<AWS_STS_SESSION_NAME>",
    "aws.sts.config.endpoint":"<AWS_STS_ENDPOINT>",
    "aws.s3.bucket.name": "<AWS_S3_NAME>",
    "aws.s3.region": "<AWS_S3_REGION>"
}
```

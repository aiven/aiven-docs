title: Enable Apache Kafka® Connect connectors auto restart on failures
---

If you experience an Apache Kafka® Connect connector failure, restarting automatically the task is generally not recommended.
Perform a proper
investigation on the problem's cause before attempting the restart to
avoid experiencing similar problems in the future. However, sometimes a
task can fail due to a rare problem like the dedicated node going out of
memory due to a huge surge of data; in such cases, the automatic task
restart usually solves the issue.

:::note
We observed cases when the Debezium source connector for PostgreSQL®
stopped working after the PostgreSQL maintenance update, due to
PostgreSQL inability to create replication slots before failover. In
such cases the connector automatic restart can be a solution to
avoid the problem.

## Enable connector automatic restart with Aiven console

Aiven provides an option to enable automatic connector restart in case
of edge situations. All our connectors support this option.

For example, you can update of an existing Debezium-PostgreSQL connector:

1.  In the [Aiven console](https://console.aiven.io/), select the Aiven
    for Apache Kafka or Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect service pages
    where the connector is defined.
1.  Select **Connectors** from the left sidebar and select the connector
    to be updated.
1.  Select the **Aiven** tab on the connectors page.
1.  Set the **Automatic restart** option to `True`

Once you have enabled automatic restart, the connector will be restarted
automatically whenever a failure is detected.

:::warning
Enabling this feature will restart the entire connector, not just the
failed tasks.

title: Aiven for Apache Kafka® Connect
---

Aiven for Apache Kafka® Connect is a fully managed **distributed Apache Kafka® integration component**, deployable in the cloud of your choice.
Apache Kafka Connect lets you integrate your existing data sources and
sinks with Apache Kafka.

With an Apache Kafka Connect connector, you can source data from an
existing technology into a topic or sink data from a topic to a target
technology by defining the endpoints.

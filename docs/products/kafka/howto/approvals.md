The **Approvals** page allows you to manage requests for Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ® resources owned by your group.
These requests can include claims for existing topics or requests to create new topics.

## Requests flow

Managing requests involves several key steps:

- **Request initiation**: Users submit a request from the Apache Kafka topic catalog to
  claim ownership of an existing topic or create a topic.
- **Request visibility**: All members of the topic's owning group can see the request on
  the **Approvals** page.
- **Review and approval**: A group member reviews the request and either approves or
  declines it.
- **Completion**: If approved, the requested change of topic ownership or topic creation
  is completed. If declined, the request is not implemented.

## Key elements

The approvals page displays the following key elements:

- **Topic**: Name of the topic
- **Type**: Type of request
- **Status**: Current status of the request
  - **Approved**: Request approved and processed
  - **Declined**: Request declined. The topic is now available for another group to claim
  - **Deleted**: Request deleted by the requester
  - **Failed**: Request cannot complete the required action  (for example, due to
    Apache Kafka cluster issues or connectivity problems)
  - **Pending**: Request awaiting approval or decline
  - **Provisioning**: Request in progress. The topic is being created on the Apache Kafka
    cluster

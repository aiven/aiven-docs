title: Connect to Apache Kafka® with Conduktor
---

[Conduktor](https://www.conduktor.io/) is a friendly user interface for
Apache Kafka, and it works well with Aiven. In fact, there is built-in
support for setting up the connection. You will need to add the CA
certificate for each of your Aiven projects to Conduktor before you can
connect, this is outlined in the steps below.

1.  Visit the **Service overview** page for your Aiven for Apache Kafka®
    service (the [Getting started with Aiven for Apache Kafka®](/docs/products/kafka/get-started) page is a good place for more information about creating
    a new service if you don't have one already).

2.  Download the **Access Key**, **Access Certificate** and **CA
    Certificate** (if you didn't have that already) into a directory on
    your computer.

3.  Choose **New Kafka Cluster** on the main pane, and click the
    **Aiven** icon. This pops up a helper screen so that you can add all
    the information needed for Aiven in a friendly format. The fields
    you need to add:

    -   Host and port, you can copy these from the **Service overview**
        page
    -   The three files downloaded: access key, access certificate and
        CA certificate

    Conduktor will create the keystore and truststore files in the
    folder that you specified, or you can choose an alternative
    location. Click the **Create** button and the helper will create the
    configuration for Conduktor to connect to your Aiven for Apache
    Kafka service.

4.  Click the **Test Kafka Connectivity** button to check that
    everything is working as expected.

    :::tip
    If you experience a Java SSL error when testing the connectivity,
    add the service CA certificate to the list of Conduktor's trusted
    certificates.

    -   Download the **CA Certificate** file to your computer.
    -   In the Conduktor application, click the settings dropdown in the
        bottom right hand side and choose **Network**.
    -   On the **Trusted Certificates** tab, select **Import** and then
        supply the CA certificate file you downloaded. Save the
        settings.

Once connected, you can visit the [Conduktor
documentation](https://docs.conduktor.io/) to learn more about using
this tool.

title: Use kcat with Aiven for Apache Kafka®
displayed_sidebar: serviceSidebar
---

The `kcat` [tool](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat) (formerly known as
`kafkacat`) is a generic non-JVM producer and consumer for Apache
Kafka®. It can be used to produce and consume records to Apache Kafka
topics as well as to list service configurations.

## Install `kcat`

`kcat` is an open source tool available from GitHub at
[https://github.com/edenhill/kcat](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat). Installation instructions are
provided in the repository README.

## Retrieve Aiven for Apache Kafka® SSL certificate files

Aiven for Apache Kafka by default enables TLS security. The certificates
can be manually downloaded from the service overview page in the Aiven
console, or via the
[dedicated Aiven CLI command](/docs/tools/cli/service/user#avn_service_user_creds_download).

## Setup a `kcat` configuration file

While `kcat` accepts all connection configuration parameters in the
command line, using a configuration file helps minimising the code
needed for any following calls. A `kcat` configuration file enabling the
connection to an Aiven for Apache Kafka® service with TLS security must
contain the following entries:

-   `bootstrap.servers`: Aiven for Apache Kafka® service URI, that can
    be found in the service overview in Aiven console
-   `security.protocol`: security protocol, SSL for the default TLS
    security settings
-   `ssl.key.location`: location of the `service.key` file
    downloaded from the service overview in Aiven console
-   `ssl.certificate.location`: location of the
    `service.cert` file downloaded from the service overview
    in Aiven console
-   `ssl.ca.location`: location of the `ca.pem` file
    downloaded from the service overview in Aiven console

An example of the `kcat` configuration file is provided below:

```
bootstrap.servers=demo-kafka.my-demo-project.aivencloud.com:17072
security.protocol=ssl
ssl.key.location=service.key
ssl.certificate.location=service.cert
ssl.ca.location=ca.pem
```

Once the content is stored in a file named `kcat.config`, this can be
referenced using the `-F` flag:

```
kcat -F kcat.config
```

Alternatively, the same settings can be specified directly on the
command line with:

```
kcat \
    -b demo-kafka.my-demo-project.aivencloud.com:17072 \
    -X security.protocol=ssl \
    -X ssl.key.location=service.key \
    -X ssl.certificate.location=service.cert \
    -X ssl.ca.location=ca.pem
```

If [SASL authentication](kafka-sasl-auth)
is enabled, then the `kcat` configuration file requires the following
entries:

```
bootstrap.servers=demo-kafka.my-demo-project.aivencloud.com:17072
ssl.ca.location=ca.pem
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanisms=SCRAM-SHA-256
sasl.username=avnadmin
sasl.password=yourpassword
```

:::tip
If you're using Aiven for Apache Kafka®, you can retrieve the `kcat`
command parameters using the dedicated
[Aiven CLI command](/docs/tools/cli/service/connection-info#avn_cli_service_connection_info_kcat).

## Produce data to an Apache Kafka® topic

Use the following code to produce a single message into topic named
`test-topic`:

```
echo test-message-content | kcat -F kcat.config -P -t test-topic -k test-message-key
```

-   `-P`: sets the producer mode
-   `-t`: specifies the topic
-   `-k`: sets the message key

The output of the above comment is a message sent to Apache Kafka®
`test-topic` containing `test-message-key` as key and
`test-message-content` as payload.

> `kcat` can use a file as input input and specify a delimiter (`-D`)
> for splitting rows into individual records for bulk loading of data.

## Consume data from an Apache Kafka® topic

Use the following code to consume messages coming from a topic named
`test-topic`:

```
kcat -F kcat.config -C -t test-topic -o -1 -e
```

-   `-C`: sets for consumer mode
-   `-t`: specifies the topic again
-   `-o`: defines the topic starting message offset (negative values are
    considered relative to the latest offset)
-   `-e`: stops `kcat` once the end of the topic is reached; without it,
    it will continuously poll Apache Kafka for new messages.

The above command retrieves the last message (`-o -1`) from the topic
named `test-topic`. Consult the `kcat` helper (by adding the `-h` flag)
for the full list of parameters.

:::tip
When consuming from a topic, setting the `-f` flag to `%t-%p: %o %S`
returns the topic name, partition, offset and size for each message.

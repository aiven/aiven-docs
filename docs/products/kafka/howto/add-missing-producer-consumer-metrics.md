title: Add client-side Apache Kafka® producer and consumer Datadog metrics
displayed_sidebar: serviceSidebar
---

When you enable the
[Datadog integration](/docs/integrations/datadog/datadog-metrics) in Aiven for Apache Kafka®, the service supports all of the
broker-side metrics listed in the [Datadog Kafka integration
documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/kafka/?tab=host#data-collected)
and allows you to send additional
[custom metrics](datadog-customised-metrics).

Additionally, you can collect client-side metrics directly from the
producer or consumer and send them to Datadog. For guidance, refer to
the *Missing producer and consumer metrics* section in the [Datadog
documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/faq/troubleshooting-and-deep-dive-for-kafka),
which outlines the process for integrating missing metrics natively for
Java-based producers and consumers. For clients using languages other
than Java, incorporating these metrics can be achieved through
[DogStatsD](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/).

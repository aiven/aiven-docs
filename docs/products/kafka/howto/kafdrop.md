title: Use Kafdrop Web UI with Aiven for Apache Kafka®
---

[Kafdrop](https://github.com/obsidiandynamics/kafdrop) is a popular Web
UI for Apache Kafka® that allows you to monitor a cluster, view topics
and consumer groups with integration into the Schema Registry, with
support for Avro, JSON and Protobuf.

## Retrieve Aiven for Apache Kafka® SSL certificate files

Aiven for Apache Kafka® by default enables TLS security. The
certificates can be manually downloaded from the service overview page
in the Aiven console, or via the
[dedicated Aiven CLI command](/docs/tools/cli/service/user#avn_service_user_creds_download).

## Setup a Kafdrop configuration file

Kafdrop supports both
[SASL and SSL authentication methods](../concepts/auth-types). The following example shows the SSL version which requires
a keystore and truststore that can be created following the
[dedicated documentation](keystore-truststore).

Once the keystore and truststore are created, you can define a Kafdrop
configuration file named `kafdrop.properties` with the following
content, replacing the `KEYSTORE_PWD` and `TRUSTSTORE_PWD` with the
keystore and truststore passwords respectively:

```
security.protocol=SSL
ssl.keystore.password=KEYSTORE_PWD
ssl.keystore.type=PKCS12
ssl.truststore.password=TRUSTSTORE_PWD
```

## Run Kafdrop on Docker

You can run Kafdrop in a Docker/Podman container with the following
command, by replacing the `KAFKA_SERVICE_URI` with the Aiven for Apache
Kafka® service URI available in the service Overview tab of the Aiven
console, and the `client.truststore.jks` and `client.keystore.p12` with
the keystores and truststores file names:

```
docker run -p 9000:9000                                                 \
    -e KAFKA_BROKERCONNECT=KAFKA_SERVICE_URI                            \
    -e KAFKA_PROPERTIES="$(cat kafdrop.properties | base64)"            \
    -e KAFKA_TRUSTSTORE="$(cat client.truststore.jks | base64)"         \
    -e KAFKA_KEYSTORE="$(cat client.keystore.p12 | base64)"             \
    obsidiandynamics/kafdrop
```

If you're also interested in Kafdrop to de-serialize Avro messages
using [Karapace](https://github.com/aiven/karapace) schema registry, add
the following two lines to the `docker run` command:

```
-e SCHEMAREGISTRY_AUTH="avnadmin:SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PWD"   \
-e SCHEMAREGISTRY_CONNECT="https://SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URI" \
```

Replace, in the above, the `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PWD` with the schema
registry password and `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URI` with the schema registry URI
that you can find in the [Aiven console](https://console.aiven.io/)
service Overview page.

## Use Kafdrop

Once Kafdrop starts, you should be able to access it at `localhost:9000`

You can perform the following tasks with Kafdrop over an Aiven for
Apache Kafka® service:

-   Create and delete topics
-   View brokers
-   view messages

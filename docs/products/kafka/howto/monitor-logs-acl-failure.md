Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ® uses access control lists (ACL) and user
definitions in order to establish individual rights to produce or
consume a topic. For more information on ACLs permission mapping, see
[Access control lists and permission mapping](../concepts/acl) section.

In cases of ACLs problems, an error
`io.aiven.kafka.auth.AivenAclAuthorizer` is generated. You can also use
the following log patterns to set up alerts for checking failed
authentication and ACL evaluation.

## Failed producer

A producer creates the following log in case the client has no privilege
to write to a specific topic:

```
HOSTNAME: kafka-pi-3141592-75
SYSTEMD_UNIT: kafka.service
MESSAGE: [2020-09-04 06:35:33,509] INFO [DENY] Auth request Write on Topic:nodejs-quickstart-kafka-topic by User test-kuser (io.aiven.kafka.auth.AivenAclAuthorizer)
```

## Failed consumer

A consumer creates the following log in case the client has no privilege
to describe a specific topic:

```
HOSTNAME: kafka-pi-3141592-74
SYSTEMD_UNIT: kafka.service
MESSAGE: [2020-09-04 06:43:09,712] INFO [DENY] Auth request Describe on Topic:nodejs-quickstart-kafka-topic by User test-kuser (io.aiven.kafka.auth.AivenAclAuthorizer)
```

## Valid certificate with invalid key {#valid-cert-with-invalid-key}

A client creates the following log when using a valid certificate with
an invalid key to perform a describe operation over a topic:

```
HOSTNAME: kafka-pi-3141592-75
SYSTEMD_UNIT: kafka.service
MESSAGE: [2020-09-04 06:54:10,781] INFO [DENY] Auth request Describe on Topic:nodejs-quickstart-kafka-topic by Invalid CN=delete-user,OU=u6l6y9h1,O=kafka-pi-3141592 (io.aiven.kafka.auth.AivenAclAuthorizer)
```

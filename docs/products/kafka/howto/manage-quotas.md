## Add quota

To add quota to your Aiven for Apache Kafka service:

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) and select the
    Aiven for Apache Kafka service you want to manage.

2.  Select **Quotas** from the left sidebar and select **Add quota**.

3.  Enter the **Client ID** or **User** for which you want to set the
    quota. The *Client ID* represents a unique identifier assigned to a
    Kafka client, while the *User* refers to the user or user group
    associated with the client.

4.  Choose one of the following quota types and enter the desired value
    for the selected quota type:

    -   **Consumer throttle** (quota limit in bytes per second): Specify
        the maximum data transfer rate allowed for the consumer.
    -   **Producer throttle** (quota limit in bytes per second): Specify
        the maximum data transfer rate allowed for the producer.
    -   **CPU throttle** (quota limit as a percentage): Specify the
        maximum CPU usage allowed for the client.

    :::note
    Aiven also supports **default** quotas, which can be applied to all
    clients and/or users by using the keyword **default** in either the
    client ID or user field.

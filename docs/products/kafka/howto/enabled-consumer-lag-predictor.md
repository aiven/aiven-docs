title: Enable the consumer lag predictor for Aiven for Apache Kafka®
limited: true
---

The
[consumer lag predictor](/docs/products/kafka/concepts/consumer-lag-predictor) in Aiven
for Apache Kafka® provides visibility into the time
between message production and consumption, allowing for improved
cluster performance and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

-   Aiven account.
-   [Aiven for Apache Kafka®](/docs/products/kafka/get-started) service running.
-   [Prometheus integration](/docs/platform/howto/integrations/prometheus-metrics) set up
    for your Aiven for Apache Kafka for extracting
    metrics.
-   Necessary permissions to modify service configurations.
-   The consumer lag predictor for Aiven for Apache Kafka® is a
    **limited availability** feature and requires activation on your Aiven account.
    Contact our sales team at sales@aiven.io to request activation.

## Enable via Aiven Console

1.  Once the consumer lag predictor is activated for your account,
    log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/),
    select your project and then choose your Aiven for Apache Kafka® service.

1.  On the service page, click **Service settings** on the sidebar.

1.  Scroll to the **Advanced configuration** section, and select
    **Configure**.

1.  In the **Advanced configuration** screen, select **Add configuration
    options**.

1.  In the add configuration options:

    -   Find and set `kafka_lag_predictor.enabled` to **Enabled**
        position. This enables the lag predictor to compute predictions
        for all consumer groups across all topics.
    -   Find `kafka_lag_predictor.group_filters` and enter the desired
        consumer group pattern. This specifies which consumer groups to
        consider during lag prediction calculations.

        :::note
        By default, the consumer lag predictor calculates the lag of all
        consumer groups. To restrict the calculation to specific groups, use
        the `kafka_lag_predictor.group_filters` option.
        :::

1.  Select **Save configuration** to save your changes and enable
    consumer lag prediction.

## Enable via Aiven CLI

Follow these steps to enable the consumer lag predictor for your Aiven
for Apache Kafka service using
[Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli).

1. Ensure the consumer lag predictor feature is activated for your account by contacting
   our sales team at sales@aiven.io. The consumer lag predictor is a limited availability
   feature and needs to be activated for your account.
1. Once activated, retrieve the project information using the following command:

   ```text
   avn project details
   ```

   If you need details for a specific project, use:

   ```text
   avn project details --project <your_project_name>
   ```

1. Get the name of the Aiven for Apache Kafka service for which you
   want to enable the consumer lag predictor by using the following
   command:

   ```text
   avn service list
   ```

   Make a note of the `SERVICE_NAME` corresponding to your Aiven for
    Apache Kafka service.

1. Enable the consumer lag predictor for your service:

   ```text
   avn service update <SERVICE_NAME> -c kafka_lag_predictor.enabled=true
   ```

   Replace \<SERVICE_NAME\> with your actual service name.

    :::note
    This enables the lag predictor to compute predictions for all
    consumer groups across all topics.
    :::

1. If you wish to specify which consumer groups should be considered
   when calculating the lag prediction, you can set the `group_filters`
   configuration:

   ```text
   avn service update <SERVICE_NAME> \
   -c kafka_lag_predictor.group_filters=\
     '["example_consumer_group_1", "example_consumer_group_2"]'
    ```

   -   Replace `<SERVICE_NAME>` with the actual name or ID of your
       Aiven for Apache Kafka® service.
   -   Replace `example_consumer_group_1` and
        `example_consumer_group_2` with your actual consumer group
        names.

## Monitor metrics with Prometheus

After enabling the consumer lag predictor, you can use Prometheus to
access and monitor detailed metrics that offer insights into your Kafka
cluster's performance. Here are the specific metrics and what they
represent:

| Metric                                             | Type    | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kafka_lag_predictor_topic_produced_records_total` | Counter | Represents the total count of records produced.                                                        |
| `kafka_lag_predictor_group_consumed_records_total` | Counter | Represents the total count of records consumed.                                                        |
| `kafka_lag_predictor_group_lag_predicted_seconds`  | Gauge   | Represents the estimated time lag, in seconds, for a consumer group to catch up to the latest message. |

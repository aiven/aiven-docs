title: Optimizing resource usage for Aiven for Apache Kafka®
---

Aiven for Apache Kafka® service plans with CPUs of 2 or less are optimized for lightweight operations, making them suitable for applications that handle fewer messages per second and do not require high throughput.

However, you might sometimes encounter an alert showing high resource usage.
These alerts typically arise when the Kafka broker memory drops too low, and the
CPU idle time is less than 15%. Understanding the reasons behind these alerts
and their mitigation ensures optimized Kafka usage and consistent application
performance.

## What triggers high resource usage

Several factors can lead to high resource usage across Aiven for Apache
Kafka plans:

-   **High Kafka Traffic:** Heavy traffic due to too many
    producer/consumer requests can cause an overload, leading to
    increased CPU and memory usage on the Kafka broker. When a Kafka
    cluster is overloaded, it may struggle to correctly assign
    leadership for a partition, potentially causing service disruptions.
-   **Excessive Kafka Partitions:** An excessive number of Kafka
    partitions for the brokers to manage effectively can lead to
    increased memory usage and IO load.
-   **Too many client connections:** When there are too many client
    connections, the memory usage can dip significantly. When your
    service's memory is low, it starts to use swap space, adding to the
    IO load. Regular use of swap space indicates your system may not
    have enough resources for its workload.

## Additional causes of high resource usage

-   **Datadog Integration:** Datadog offers essential monitoring, but
    its agent is IO-intensive. Especially on plans not designed for high
    IO operations, Datadog can notably increase the IO load. The load
    from Datadog also increases with the number of topic partitions in
    your Kafka service.
-   **Karapace Integration:** Karapace provides a REST API for Kafka,
    but this can consume a substantial amount of memory and contribute
    to a high load when REST API is used in high demand.

## Strategies to minimize resource usage

-   **Reduce Topic Partition Limit:** Decreasing the number of topic
    partitions reduces the load on the Kafka service.
-   **Disable Datadog Integration:** If Datadog sends too many metrics,
    it can affect the reliability of the service and hinder the backup
    of topic configurations. It is recommended to turn off the
    integration of the Datadog service.
-   **Enable Quotas:** Quotas can manage the resources consumed by
    clients, preventing any single client from using too much of the
    broker's resources.
-   **Limit the Number of Integrations:** For smaller plans such as the
    Startup-2, consider limiting the number of integrations to manage
    resource consumption effectively.
-   **Upgrade Your Plan:** If your application demands more resources,
    upgrading to a larger Kafka plan can ensure stable operation.

## Integration advisory for Kafka Startup-2 plan

Aiven for Apache Kafka service plans with CPUs of 2 or less operate on
relatively small machines. Enabling integrations like Datadog or
Karapace might exceed the resources these plans offer, impacting your
cluster's performance. If you experience issues with your cluster or
require more resources for your integrations, consider upgrading to a
higher plan.

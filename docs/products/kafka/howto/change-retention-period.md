title: Change data retention period
---

To avoid running out of disk space, by default, Apache Kafka® drops the
oldest messages from the beginning of each log after their retention
period expires. **Aiven for Apache Kafka®** allows you to configure the
retention period for each topic.

The retention period can be configured at both the service and topic
levels. If no retention period is specified for a particular topic, the
service-level setting will be applied, with a default value of 168
hours. When modifying the service retention period, it will override the
retention period of any previously created topics.

## For a single topic

To change the retention period for a single topic, follow these steps:

1.  In the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), select your
    project and then choose your Aiven for Apache Kafka® service.

2.  Select **Topics** from the left sidebar.

3.  Select the topic from the **Topics** screen for which you want to
    modify the retention period.

4.  In the **Topic info** screen, select **Modify**.

5.  In the modify topic screen, update the value of **Retention ms** to
    the desired retention length in milliseconds. If you cannot find
    **Retention ms**, use the search bar to locate it

    :::note
    The **Retention ms** option is displayed in the modify topic screen
    for topics where advanced configuration was enabled during topic
    creation.
    :::

6.  Select **Update** to save your changes.

7.  In the *Advanced configuration* view find **Retention ms**.

8.  Change the value of **Retention ms** value to the desired retention
    length in milliseconds.

    :::tip
    You can also change **Retention bytes** setting if you want to limit
    amount of data retained based on the storage usage.
    :::

## At a service level

1.  In the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), select your
    project and then choose your Aiven for Apache Kafka® service.
2.  In the service page, select **Service settings** from the sidebar.
3.  On the **Service settings** page, scroll down to the **Advanced
    configuration** section, and click **Configure**.
4.  In the **Advanced configuration** dialog, click **Add configuration
    options**.
5.  You have two options to configure the retention period for Apache
    Kafka® logs:
    -   You can either find `kafka.log_retention_hours` or
        `kafka.log_retention_ms` and set the desired length of time for
        retention.
    -   Alternatively, if you prefer to limit the amount of data
        retained based on storage usage, you can specify the value for
        `kafka.log_retention_bytes`.
6.  Click **Save configuration**.

## Unlimited retention

We do not limit the maximum retention period in any way, and in order to
disable time-based content expiration altogether set the retention value
to `-1`.

:::warning
Using high retention periods without monitoring the available storage
space can cause your service to run out of disk space. These situations
are not covered by our SLA.

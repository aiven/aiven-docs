Aiven provides a schema registry for the Aiven for Apache Kafka® service through [Karapace](https://karapace.io/), an open-source solution that acts as a central repository for storing and retrieving schemas.
Karapace ensures data consistency and compatibility across your Kafka setup, and can be
used with any Apache Kafka service.

With Karapace, you can access both **schema registry functionality** and a **REST API**,
fully supported by all Aiven for Apache Kafka® services. You can
[enable or disable](/docs/products/kafka/karapace/howto/enable-karapace)
these features based on your specific requirements.

Karapace offers capability similar to traditional schema registries, with added
flexibility and the benefits of an open-source solution that works with any
Apache Kafka environment.

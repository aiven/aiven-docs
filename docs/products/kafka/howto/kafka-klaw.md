title: Connect Aiven for Apache Kafka® with Klaw
---

[Klaw](https://www.klaw-project.io/) is an open-source, web-based data
governance toolkit for managing Apache Kafka® Topics, ACLs, Schemas, and
Connectors. Klaw provides a self-service user interface where teams of
Apache Kafka service users can request changes to the Apache Kafka
configuration without the intervention of administrators.

This article provides you with the steps to connect Aiven for Apache
Kafka® service with Klaw.

## Prerequisites

To connect Aiven for Apache Kafka® and Klaw, you need to have the
following setup:

-   A running Aiven for Apache Kafka® service. See
    [Getting started with Aiven for Apache Kafka](/docs/products/kafka/get-started) for more information.
-   A running Klaw cluster. See [Run Klaw from the
    source](https://www.klaw-project.io/docs/quickstart) for more
    information.
-   Configured
    [Java keystore and truststore containing the service SSL certificates](/docs/products/kafka/howto/keystore-truststore).

## Connect Aiven for Apache Kafka® to Klaw

Follow the below steps to configure and connect Aiven for Apache Kafka®
with Klaw:

1.  Log in to the **Klaw web interface**.

2.  Click **Environments**, and then click **Clusters**.

3.  On the **Clusters** page, click **Add Cluster** to add an Aiven for
    Apache Kafka® cluster.

4.  Enter the following details:

    -   **Cluster Type:** Select Kafka from the drop-down list
    -   **Cluster Name:** Provide a name for the cluster
    -   **Protocol:** Select the protocol for your cluster

    :::note
    Based on the protocol selected, you need to
    [configure Klaw application.properties file](/docs/products/kafka/howto/kafka-klaw#klaw-application-properties-configs) to enable connection between Aiven for Apache Kafka® and
    Klaw clusters.
    :::

    -   **Kafka Flavor:** Select Aiven for Apache Kafka® as the flavor
    -   **Project Name:** Select the project name defined in the Aiven
        Console
    -   **Bootstrap server:** Enter the Service URI for your Apache
        Kafka service. You can find the service URI in the **Connection
        information** page of your service in Aiven Console
    -   **Service Name:** Enter the name of the service as defined in
        the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) for your Apache
        Kafka service

5.  Click **Save**.

6.  Next, add the cluster to the preferred environment. Select
    **Environments**, and then select **Environments** from the
    drop-down menu.

7.  Click **Add Environment** and enter the details to add Kafka
    environment:

    -   **Environment Name:** Select environment from the drop-down list

        :::note
        To learn more, see [Clusters and
        environments](https://www.klaw-project.io/docs/Concepts/clusters-environments)
        in Klaw documentation.
        :::

    -   **Select Cluster:** Select the cluster you added from the
        drop-down list. The bootstrap servers and protocol details are
        automatically populated

    -   **Default Partitions:** Enter the number of partitions based on
        your requirements. The default value is set to 2

    -   **Maximum Partitions:** Enter the maximum number of partitions.
        The default value is set to 2

    -   **Default Replication factor:** Enter the required replication
        factor. The default value is set to 1

    -   **Max Replication factor:** Enter the required max replication
        factor. The default value is set to 1

    -   **Topic prefix (optional):** Enter a topic prefix

    -   **Tenant:** The value is set to default Tenant

        :::note
        Klaw is multi-tenant by default. Each tenant manages topics with
        their own teams in isolation. Every tenant has its own set of
        Apache Kafka® environments, and users of one tenant cannot
        view/access topics, or ACLS from other tenants. It provides
        isolation avoiding any security breach. For this topic, I have
        used the default tenant configuration. For more information, see
        [Klaw
        documentation](https://www.klaw-project.io/docs/getstarted#configure-the-cluster-to-sync).
        :::

8.  Click **Save**.

If the connection based on the cluster and environment configurations
are **successful**, the connection status displays a **blue thumbs-up
icon** on the Environments page in the Klaw web interface. If it is
**unsuccessful**, a **red thumbs-down icon** is displayed.

For unsuccessful connections, check the authentication protocol
configurations. See the
[Configure Klaw application.properties file](/docs/products/kafka/howto/kafka-klaw#klaw-application-properties-configs) section for further details. After completing these
configurations, check the connection status on the Environments page by
clicking the thumbs-down icon to see if the setup was successful.

## Configure Klaw application.properties file {#klaw-application-properties-configs}

[Klaw](https://www.klaw-project.io/) uses the `application.properties`
file to configure any application-related properties, such as secret key
and authentication protocol configurations. Connecting Aiven for Apache
Kafka® with Klaw requires you to perform the following additional
configurations in the `application.properties` file.

### Secret key configuration

Set the value of `klaw.clusterapi.access.base64.secret` with a secret
key in the form of a Base64 encoded string in the
`application.properties` file located in the following paths:

-   `klaw/cluter-api/src/main/resources`
-   `klaw/core/src/main/resources`

### Configure authentication protocol

You can connect Aiven for Apache Kafka® using either of the following
authentication protocols:

-   `PLAINTEXT`
-   `SSL`, `SASL PLAIN`, `SASL SSL`
-   `SASL SSL (GSSAPI / Kerberos)`, `SASL_SSL (SCRAM SHA 256/512)`

:::note
If you are using `PLAINTEXT`, you do not need to perform any additional
configuration.
:::

#### Connect using SSL protocol

To use SSL as the authentication protocol to connect the Apache Kafka®
cluster to Klaw, you need to perform the following steps:

##### Retrieve SSL certificate files

You need to retrieve the Aiven for Apache Kafka SSL certificate files.
Aiven for Apache Kafka® by default enables TLS security. Download the
certificates from the service overview page in the Aiven console or via
the
[dedicated page](/docs/tools/cli/service/user#avn_service_user_kafka_java_creds).

Considering you have already configured the
[Java SSL keystore and truststore files](/docs/products/kafka/howto/keystore-truststore), move the keystore named `client.keystore.p12` and
truststore named `client.truststore.jks` into a directory that can be
easily accessed and configured with Klaw.

##### Configure SSL properties

After retrieving the SSL certificate files and configuring the SSL
keystore and truststore files, you need to configure these SSL values in
the `application.properties` file.

1.  Get the **Cluster ID** by clicking the copy icon on the **Clusters**
    page in the **Klaw web interface**.

2.  Next, open the `application.properties` file located in the
    `klaw/cluster-api/src/main/resources` directory.

3.  Configure the SSL properties to connect to Apache Kafka® clusters by
    editing the following lines:

    ```
    klawssl.kafkassl.keystore.location=client.keystore.p12
    klawssl.kafkassl.keystore.pwd=klaw1234
    klawssl.kafkassl.key.pwd=klaw1234
    klawssl.kafkassl.truststore.location=client.truststore.jks
    klawssl.kafkassl.truststore.pwd=klaw1234
    klawssl.kafkassl.keystore.type=pkcs12
    klawssl.kafkassl.truststore.type=JKS
    ```

    -   For the lines starting with `klawssl`, replace `klawssl` with
        the Klaw Cluster ID.
    -   Replace `client.keystore.p12` with the path for the keystore and
        `klaw1234` with the password configured for the keystore file.
    -   Replace `client.truststore.jks` with the path for the truststore
        and `klaw1234` with the password configured for the truststore
        file.
    -   Save the `application.properties` file.

    The following is an example of an `application.properties` file
    configured with Klaw Cluster ID, keystore, and truststore paths and
    passwords.

    ```
    demo_cluster.kafkassl.keystore.location=/Users/demo.user/Documents/Klaw/demo-certs/client.keystore.p12
    demo_cluster.kafkassl.keystore.pwd=Aiventest123!
    demo_cluster.kafkassl.key.pwd=Aiventest123!
    demo_cluster.kafkassl.truststore.location=/Users/demo.user/Documents/Klaw/demo-certs/client.truststore.jks
    demo_cluster.kafkassl.truststore.pwd=Aiventest123!
    demo_cluster.kafkassl.keystore.type=pkcs12
    demo_cluster.kafkassl.truststore.type=JKS
    ```

    :::note
    To add multiple SSL configurations, copy and paste the above lines
    by prefixing them with the required cluster identification and
    relevant certificates.
    :::

#### Connect using SASL protocols

To use protocols, such as `SASL_PLAIN`, `SASL_SSL/PLAIN`, and
`SASL_SSL/GSSAPI`, in the `application.properties` file, look for the
lines starting with `acc1.kafkasasl.jaasconfig.<>`, uncomment the line
and enter the required values. Save the `application.properties` file.

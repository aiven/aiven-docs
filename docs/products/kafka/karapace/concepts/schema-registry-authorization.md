The schema registry authorization feature when enabled in
[Karapace schema registry](/docs/products/kafka/karapace/howto/enable-karapace) allows you to authenticate the user, and control read or
write access to the individual resources available in the Schema
Registry. Authorization in Karapace is achieved by using
[Access Control Lists (ACLs)](/docs/products/kafka/karapace/concepts/acl-definition). ACLs provide a way to achieve fine-grained access control
for the resources in Karapace.

:::note
Karapace schema registry authorization is enabled on all Aiven for
Apache KafkaÂ® services. The exception is older services created before
mid-2022, where the feature needs to be
[enabled](/docs/products/kafka/karapace/howto/enable-schema-registry-authorization).

## Common use cases

Some of the common use cases for Karapace schema registry authorization
include:

-   **Schemas as API contract among teams:** Allow teams to leverage
    schemas as API contracts with other teams by providing read-only
    access to schemas in Schema Registry.
-   **Kafka as a communication broker with third parties:** Allow
    conditional read-only access to schemas by third parties to
    establish Kafka topics as communication channels.
-   **Schema registration automated with CI/CD:** Achieve automation of
    schema registration using Continuous Integration(CI) tools in such a
    way that add, update and delete operations on schemas is limited to
    the CI Tools. At the same time, the different applications are
    allowed read-only access to the schemas as needed.
-   **Segregated consumers of Schema Registry and REST Proxy:** Limits
    the attack surface by segregating and limiting access to only what
    is required for the consumers of the Schema Registry and REST Proxy.

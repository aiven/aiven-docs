Aiven services are managed in the Aiven [web
console](https://console.aiven.io/) . When you first log into the
console with your email address and password, you will see the
**Services** view, which shows you all the services in the currently
selected project.

:::warning
Aiven for Apache Kafka速 MirrorMaker 2 services can be created only
alongside at least one existing Aiven for Apache Kafka running service.
If your project doesn't contain any Aiven for Apache Kafka services,
create one before attempting to create an Aiven for Apache Kafka
MirrorMaker 2 service.

## Creating a dedicated Aiven for Apache Kafka速 MirrorMaker 2 service {#apache_kafka_mirrormaker_dedicated_cluster}

Create a new Aiven for Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 dedicated service:

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) and select
    the **Aiven for Apache Kafka速** service for which you want to create
    a dedicated Aiven for Apache Kafka速 MirrorMaker 2 service.
2.  Click **Integrations** on the sidebar.
3.  On the **Integrations** screen, choose **Apache Kafka MirrorMaker**.
4.  Select the **New service** option.
5.  Provide a name for your service. By default, a random name is
    generated, but you can enter a more identifiable name to distinguish
    it from other services.
6.  Select the cloud provider and region where you want to deploy the
    service.

:::note
Pricing may vary across providers and regions.

7.  Select a service plan. This defines how many servers and what kind
    of memory, CPU, and disk resources are allocated to your service.
8.  Specify a **Cluster alias**. This alias is a name assigned to an
    Apache Kafka cluster within MirrorMaker 2. It helps identify and
    differentiate the source and target clusters used for replication.
    Ensure careful selection, as the cluster alias cannot be modified
    once the integration is created.
9.  Select **Create and enable** under the summary on the right side of
    the console.

Accessing the integration link at the top of the screen will take you to
the Service Overview page for the newly created Apache Kafka
integration. Monitor the service status on the **Service overview**
page, and wait until it transitions from REBUILDING to RUNNING to use
its full functionality.

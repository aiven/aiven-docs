title: Disaster recovery and migration
---

MirrorMaker 2 is the standard replication tool packaged with the Apache Kafka® and can be run as a managed service on the Aiven platform.
MirrorMaker 2 uses Kafka Connect to consume from one Kafka cluster and
produce simultaneously to a second cluster. You can use MirrorMaker 2 to
enable Active-Passive disaster recovery architecture or active-active
high availability architecture.

## Disaster recovery

Disaster recovery is one of the primary use cases for MirrorMaker 2.
MirrorMaker 2 replicates data between Apache Kafka® clusters, including
clusters located in different data centres. It's possible to
minimise the period of unavailability of Apache Kafka.

However, it's important to remember that **MirrorMaker 2 does not offer
synchronous replication**, which means that the latest records accepted
into a topic in the source cluster may not replicate to the target
cluster before the source cluster fails.

As MirrorMaker 2 is based on Kafka Connect, there are tradeoffs between
throughput and out-of-order or duplicated records.

It's important to understand that disaster recovery has no
one-size-fits-all solution. Different requirements should be considered,
such as the nature of the data, volume, acceptable ops overhead, and
costs.

## Migration

Migrating an Apache Kafka® cluster to Aiven will utilize the same
pattern as disaster recovery. In this case however, you will need to use
an external Kafka integration via the Aiven platform. You can use this
registered integration in the replication flow to migrate data from an
external Kafka cluster to an Aiven for Apache Kafka cluster.

:::note
MirrorMaker 2 can be set up using any Aiven standard provisioning method
Console, API, CLI, and TF.

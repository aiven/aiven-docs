title: Active-passive setup
---

In this setup, there are two Apache Kafka® clusters, the primary and
secondary clusters. The primary cluster contains the *topic* topic. The
\"active\" cluster serves all produce and consume requests, while the
\"passive\" cluster serves as a replica of the \"active\" cluster
without running any applications against it.

-   All the clients (producers and consumers) work with primary.
    MirrorMaker 2 replicates the topic from primary to secondary (the
    remote topic name is `primary_alias.topic_name` where
    `primary_alias` is remote topic name).
-   In case a disaster happens to the primary cluster and it becomes
    inaccessible for a long time for all the clients as well as
    MirrorMaker 2, the replication stops and some data may remain
    un-replicated in the primary cluster, i.e., it may not reach the
    secondary cluster before the disaster.
-   The clients switch to the secondary cluster. Consumers continue
    consuming from the replicated topic `primary.topic`, and the
    producers start producing into this topic.
-   Alternatively, identical topics can be created in both primary and
    secondary clusters by setting replication flow to use
    [IdentityReplicationPolicy replication policy](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-mirrormaker/howto/remove-mirrormaker-prefix). The producers start producing into it directly, and
    consumers switch to it when they are done processing remote
    primary.topic. This approach might be more convenient when a future
    fallback to the primary cluster is needed.

**Disaster Recovery**

To enable a DR scenario, the backup cluster (Cluster B) must have topics
with the same name as the primary cluster (Cluster A). By default, this
is not the case, so all replication flows must use the
[IdentityReplicationPolicy replication policy](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-mirrormaker/howto/remove-mirrormaker-prefix) to guarantee this.

When a replication flow is created, it will mirror all topics based upon
the allow list or deny list configuration of the replication flow. The
allow list should be set .\* to guarantee that all internal topics such
as consumer offsets for Apache Kafka® Connectors and consumer groups,
and schemas for
[Karapace](/docs/products/kafka/karapace).

**Failover**

When a cluster is replicated using MM2, it will have a different service
URI and certificates that need to be considered when transitioning
applications to the backup cluster instead of the primary one.

Given that Cluster B is designed for DR failover, promoting Cluster A as
the primary cluster after a failover scenario requires recreating the
data in Cluster A from Cluster B using MM2, but in reverse. Existing
topic data in Cluster A must be deleted to avoid duplicates since all
data from Cluster B would be replicated.

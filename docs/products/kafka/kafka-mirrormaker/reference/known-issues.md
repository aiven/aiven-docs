## MirrorMaker 2 may translate offsets incorrectly if LAG shows negative on the target cluster

The following are known issues that are expected to be resolved in
version 3.3.0. See
[recommended tuning parameters](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-mirrormaker/concepts/mirrormaker2-tuning) to mitigate the impact of these issues.

-   **MirrorMaker 2 offset sync is incorrect if the target partition is
    empty**: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12635)
-   `Kafka-12635`: **Don't emit checkpoints for partitions without any
    offset**: [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11748](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11748)
-   **MM2 creates invalid checkpoint when offset mapping is not
    available**: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13452](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13452)
-   `Kafka-13452`: **MM2 shouldn't checkpoint when offset mapping is
    unavailable**: [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11492](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11492)

## MirrorMaker 2 is always set `min.insync.replicas = 1` in destination cluster topics

If a topic on the destination cluster is updated or pre-created with
`min.insync.replicas > 1` , MirrorMaker 2 would always be overwritten
with `min.insync.replicas = 1` in target topics. The replication factor
of target topics does not match the replication factor of source topics
either when they are newly created by MirrorMaker 2, or when they exist
beforehand.

-   MirrorMaker 2 does not update `replicas`.
-   MirrorMaker 2 always overwrites `min.insync.replicas` as 1.

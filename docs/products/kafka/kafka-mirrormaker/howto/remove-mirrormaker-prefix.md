title: Remove topic prefix when replicating with Apache Kafka® MirrorMaker 2
---

When using Apache Kafka® MirrorMaker 2 to replicate topics across Apache
Kafka® clusters, the default target topic name is in the form
`<SOURCE_CLUSTER_ALIAS>.<TOPIC_NAME>`. for example, if the source Apache Kafka
clusters alias is `src-kafka`, replicating the source topic named
`orders` via Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 creates a target topic named
`src-kafka.orders`.

For most use cases, the extra prefix is not an issue. However, you might
be using a backup Apache Kafka cluster for Disaster Recovery. In this
scenario, you want your consumers and producers to be able to switch
with minimal downtime and without needing to modify the topic names in
their configuration.

In such cases, to remove the topic prefix, you\'ll need to change the
replication flow `replication_policy_class` parameter from the default
`org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.DefaultReplicationPolicy` value which
includes the source cluster alias in the target topic name to
`org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.IdentityReplicationPolicy`.

The change can be performed via the [Aiven
console](https://console.aiven.io/) by modifying the flow details in the
service page \"Replication Flow\" tab, or via
[Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli) as described
in the following section.

## Remove topic prefix from a replication flow

To remove the source cluster alias as topic prefix in an existing
replication flow via the [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli) execute the following command, replacing the
`<MIRRORMAKER_SERVICE_NAME>`, `<SOURCE_CLUSTER_ALIAS>` and
`<TARGET_CLUSTER_ALIAS>` placeholders:

```
avn MirrorMaker replication-flow update <MIRRORMAKER_SERVICE_NAME> \
    --source-cluster <SOURCE_CLUSTER_ALIAS>                         \
    --target-cluster <TARGET_CLUSTER_ALIAS>                         \
    "{\"replication_policy_class\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.IdentityReplicationPolicy\"}"
```

In case you need to revert the policy and include the source cluster
alias as topic prefix, execute the above command passing the
`org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.DefaultReplicationPolicy` value.

:::warning
The `org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.IdentityReplicationPolicy`
replication policy **doesn\'t support active-active replication** as the
topics keep the same name and offsets can not be accurately tracked.
Creating the same replication flows between a source and a destination
with `org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.IdentityReplicationPolicy` policy
creates an infinite loop.

For active-active, please use the
`org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.DefaultReplicationPolicy`.

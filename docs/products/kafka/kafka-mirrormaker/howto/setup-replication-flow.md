title: Set up an Apache Kafka速 MirrorMaker 2 replication flow
---

Apache Kafka速 MirrorMaker 2 **replication flows** enable the topics sync
from a source Apache Kafka速 cluster to a target Apache Kafka cluster
deployed anywhere in the world. Replication flows can be defined against
Aiven for Apache Kafka services or external
[Apache Kafka clusters](integrate-external-kafka-cluster).

## Set up an Apache Kafka速 MirrorMaker 2 replication flow using Aiven console

To define a replication flow between a source Apache Kafka cluster and a
target cluster:

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) and select
    the **Aiven for Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2** service where you want
    to define the replication flow.

:::note
If no Aiven for Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 are already defined,
[you can create one in the Aiven console](../get-started).
:::

2.  In the service **Overview** screen, scroll to the **Service
    integrations** section and select **Manage integrations**.
3.  If there is no integration for the source/target Apache Kafka
    cluster, follow these steps to set up the necessary integrations:
    -   On the Integrations screen, choose the desired integration from
        the list for the source Apache Kafka cluster.
    -   Select an existing Apache Kafka service you want to use as the
        source/target for the replication flow.
    -   Provide a cluster alias name (for example,, source-Kafka) to the
        integration of the Apache Kafka cluster.
    -   Repeat the above steps to set up the integration for the target
        Apache Kafka cluster and provide a cluster alias name.
4.  Once that the source and target Apache Kafka clusters are configure,
    select **Replication flows** from the left sidebar.
5.  Select **Create replication flow**.
6.  On the Create new replication flow screen, define the replication
    source and target cluster, the
    [list of topics to be included or excluded](../concepts/replication-flow-topics-regex) and the sync settings.
7.  Select **Create**.
8.  In the target Apache Kafka cluster, verify the replicated topics
    with the topic name `source-cluster-alias.source-topic-name`.

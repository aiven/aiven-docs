title: Automatic adjustment of replication factors
---

Aiven for OpenSearchÂ® automatically adjusts index replication factors to ensure data availability and service functionality.

The maximum value for `number_of_replicas` is the number of nodes in the
cluster - 1, as it is not possible to replicate indexes (shards) to a
larger number of nodes than exist on the cluster

For example, for a 3-node cluster, the maximum `number_of_replicas` is
2, which means all shards on the index are replicated to all 3 nodes.

If `number_of_replicas` is set to 0 in a multi-node cluster, it is
automatically increased to 1 to ensure no data-loss occurs if one node
is lost.

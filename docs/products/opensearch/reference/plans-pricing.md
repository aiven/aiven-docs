## Billing

All Aiven services, including Aiven for OpenSearch, are billed based on
actual usage, which means you only pay for what you use: no up-front
fees and no termination charges.

The minimum hourly charge unit is one hour. Powering off or deleting a
service stops the accumulation of charges immediately. We calculate your
final bill based on your consumption over that period and deliver it as
a single invoice per project. For generating a consolidated invoice
across multiple projects, [manage billing groups in Aiven
Console](/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups).

### Billing on partial hours

Minutes of usage are rounded to the nearest hour. However, the one-hour
minimum charge unit still applies.

title: Low disk space watermarks
---

OpenSearchÂ® relies on three indicators to identify and respond to low disk space.

## Disk allocation low watermark

Defined by parameter `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low` and
the default value is set to 85% of the disk space.

When this limit is exceeded, OpenSearch starts avoiding allocating new
shards to the server. On a single-server OpenSearch, this has no effect.
On a multi-server cluster, amount of data is not always equally
distributed, in which case this will help balancing disk usage between
servers.

## Disk allocation high watermark

Defined by parameter `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high`
and the default value is set to 90% of the disk space.

When this limit is exceeded, OpenSearch will actively try to move shards
to other servers with more available disk space. On a single-server
OpenSearch, this has no effect.

## Disk allocation flood stage watermark

Defined by parameter
`cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage` and the default
value is set to 95% of the disk space.

When this limit is exceeded, OpenSearch will mark all indices hosted on
the server exceeding this limit as read-only, allowing deletes
(`index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete`).

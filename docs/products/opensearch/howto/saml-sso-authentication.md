sidebar_label: Enable SAML authenttication
---

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a standard protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP).

SAML enables users to
authenticate themselves to a service provider with credentials from a
trusted third-party identity provider without the need to create and
manage separate user accounts for each service provider.

SAML authentication on Aiven for OpenSearch® can enhance the
authentication process for users, providing increased security and a
more streamlined experience. OpenSearch can delegate
authentication and authorization to a trusted external identity
provider, reducing security risks and simplifying user management.
Additionally, this allows for Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality,
enabling users to access several OpenSearch instances without the need
to log in multiple times.

:::important
When you fork an Aiven for OpenSearch® service, any Single Sign-On (SSO)
methods configured at the service level, such as SAML, must be
explicitly reconfigured for the forked service. SSO configurations are
linked to specific URLs and endpoints, which change during forking.
Failing to reconfigure SSO methods for the forked service can lead to
authentication problems and potentially disrupt user access.

## Prerequisites

-   Aiven for OpenSearch® version 2.4 or later is required. If you are
    using an earlier version, upgrade to the latest version.
-   OpenSearch Security management must be
    [enabled](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/enable-opensearch-security) on the Aiven for OpenSearch® service.
-   You will need a SAML identity provider (IdP), the Metadata URL, and
    IdP entity ID.

## Configure SAML on IdP

To enable SAML SSO Authentication for Aiven for OpenSearch,
configure SAML with an Identity Provider (IdP). As Aiven for OpenSearch
is designed to work with various IdPs, the configuration steps may
differ depending on your IdP. Refer to your Identity Provider's
documentation for detailed instructions on configuring SAML
applications.

To enable SAML SSO authentication, make sure you have correctly
configured your IdP and have the following two critical parameters:

-   **IdP Metadata URL**: The IdP metadata URL provides essential
    metadata about your IdP, including the certificate used for signing
    the SAML response.
-   **IdP Entity ID** : The IdP Entity ID is the identifier that the IdP
    uses to recognize itself. To establish trust between Aiven and
    OpenSearch, Aiven uses the Entity ID value for OpenSearch. You can
    find the *IdP Entity ID* in your Identity Provider's metadata or
    configuration settings.

## Enable SAML SSO authentication via Aiven Console

To enable SAML authentication for your Aiven for OpenSearch service:

1.  On your Aiven for OpenSearch service, select **Users** from the left
    sidebar.
2.  In the **SAML SSO Authentication** section, select **Enable SAML**.
3.  On the **Configure SAML Authentication** screen, enter the following
    details:
    -   **SSO URL**: This is a distinct URL assigned to each Aiven for
        OpenSearch service and serves as the destination where the
        Identity Provider (IdP) sends SAML responses after a user has
        been authenticated successfully. It is a fixed URL that cannot
        be modified.

    -   **IdP Metadata URL**: Enter the URL of your SAML Identity
        Provider's (IdP) metadata that Aiven will use to authenticate
        users.

    -   **IdP Entity ID**: Enter the unique identifier assigned to your
        Identity Provider (IdP). This identifier assists Aiven in
        distinguishing between various IdPs.

    -   **SP Entity ID**: Enter a unique identifier the IdP uses to
        recognize and authenticate Aiven for OpenSearch as the service
        provider.

        :::note
        The SP Entity ID can be any arbitrary value defined by the user.
        Additionally, OpenSearch suggests creating a new application for
        OpenSearch Dashboards and using the URL of your OpenSearch
        Dashboards as the SP entity ID.
        :::

    -   **SAML roles key**: This is an optional field that allows you to
        map SAML roles to Aiven for OpenSearch roles.

    -   **SAML subject key**: This is also an optional field that allows
        you to map SAML subject to Aiven for OpenSearch users.
4.  Select **Enable**.
5.  In the **SAML SSO Authentication** section, you can see the SAML
    method configured with the status set to **Enabled**.

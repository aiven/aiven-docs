title: Manage users and access control in Aiven for OpenSearchÂ®
---

Effective access control and permissions management are crucial for
Aiven for OpenSearch service users. In Aiven for OpenSearch, you can
manage users and permissions by creating Access Control Lists (ACLs)
through the Aiven Console.

By using the **Users** tab in the [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io) for your Aiven for OpenSearch
service, you can manage access control and permissions for your service
users. You can create new users, modify their details, and assign index
patterns and permissions for each user.

:::note
Alternatively, you can enable
[OpenSearch Security management](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/enable-opensearch-security) for your Aiven for OpenSearch service and manage users and
permissions via the OpenSearch Security dashboard.

## Create user without access control

To create a service new user without any access control in Aiven
Console, follow these steps:

1.  In the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io), open the Aiven for
    OpenSearch service where you want to add a user.
2.  Select **Users** from the left sidebar.
3.  Select **Create users**, enter a username, and select **Save**.

By default, newly created users will be granted **full access rights**.
However, to limit their access, you can enable access control and
specify an Access Control List (ACL) for them, defining the relevant
permissions and patterns.

## Enable access control

To enable access control for the Aiven for OpenSearch service through
the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io), go to the **Users**
tab and toggle the **Access Control** switch to enable it.

## Create user with access control

To create a service new user with access control, follow these steps:

1.  In your Aiven for OpenSearch service, select **Users** from the left
    sidebar.
2.  Select **Create user**.
3.  In the **Create service user** screen, enter a **username**.
4.  Specify an **index** pattern and set the desired **permissions**.
5.  Add multiple rules to the user by selecting **Add another rule**.
6.  Select **Save** to finish, and view the new user in the list.

:::note
The password for service users is automatically generated and can be
reset if necessary.
:::

After creating a new service user, the next step is for them to log in
to the
[OpenSearch Dashboard](/docs/products/opensearch/dashboards) using their assigned credentials. This will grant them
access to the dashboard, where they can perform various actions based on
their assigned permissions.

## Manage users

Aiven for OpenSearch provides several additional operations you can
perform on service users, such as viewing, copying, resetting passwords,
editing ACL rules, and deleting users.

To access the additional operations, go to the **Users** tab
within your Aiven for OpenSearch service, select the ellipsis (More
options) in the respective user row, and choose the desired operation.

:::note
Deleting a service user will terminate all existing database sessions,
and the user will lose access immediately.

## Disable access control

Disabling access control for your Aiven for OpenSearch service will
grant admin access to all users and override any previously defined user
permissions. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider the
outcomes of disabling access control before proceeding.

To disable access control:

1.  Select **Users** from the left sidebar within your Aiven for
    OpenSearch service, toggle the **Access Control** switch to off.
2.  Confirm the decision to disable access control by clicking
    **Disable** when prompted.

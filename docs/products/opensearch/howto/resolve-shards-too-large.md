title: Manage large shards in OpenSearch®
---

Ensuring an optimal shard size is a critical consideration when
operating within OpenSearch. It is recommended that the size of
individual shards in OpenSearch® should not exceed 50GB as a best
practice.

While OpenSearch does not explicitly enforce this shard size limit.
However, exceeding this limit may result in OpenSearch being unable to
relocate or recover index shards, potentially leading to data loss.

Aiven proactively monitors shard sizes for all OpenSearch services. If a
service's shard exceeds the recommended size, prompt notifications are
sent using the user alert
`user_alert_resource_usage_es_shard_too_large`. Below, you\'ll find
recommended solutions on how to address this alert.

## Solutions to address large shards

When dealing with excessively large shards, you can consider the one of
the following solutions:

### 1. Delete records from the index

If your application permits, permanently delete records, such as old
logs or unnecessary records, from your index. For example, to delete
records older than five days, use the following query:

```
POST /my-index/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
     "range" : {
         "@timestamp" : {

              "lte" : now-5d

            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Re-index into several small indices

You can split your index into several smaller indices based on certain
criteria. For example, to create an index for each `event_type`, you can
use following script:

```
POST _reindex
{

  "source": {
    "index": "logs-all-events"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "logs-2-"
  },
  "script": {
    "lang": "painless",
    "source": "ctx._index = 'logs-2-' + (ctx._source.event_type)"
  }
}
```

### 3. Re-index into a new index with increased shard count

Another strategy involves re-indexing data into a fresh index while
increasing the number of shards. To create a new index with 2 shards,
use the following commands:

```python
PUT /my_new_index/_settings
{
    "index" : {
        "number_of_shards" : 2
    }
}
```

Once the new index is set up, proceed to re-index your data using the
following commands:

```python
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "my_old_index"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "my_new_index"
  }
}
```

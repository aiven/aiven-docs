Aiven for OpenSearch® allows you to choose the version that best fits your needs and upgrade when ready.

## Multi-version: how it works

Aiven for OpenSearch supports multiple minor and major versions.

### Default version

When
[creating a Aiven for OpenSearch service](/docs/products/opensearch/get-started#create-an-aiven-for-opensearch-service),
you can select the starting version. See all available versions in
[Versions of Aiven-managed services and tools](/docs/platform/reference/eol-for-major-versions#aiven-for-opensearch).

### Voluntary manual upgrades

Except few [specific cases](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/os-version-upgrade#mandatory-automatic-upgrades),
upgrades are voluntary and requires
[your action](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/os-version-upgrade#upgrade-your-service).

- Upgrading between minor versions of the **same major version**:
  [upgrade](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/os-version-upgrade#upgrade-your-service)
  directly to the target version.
- Upgrading between minor versions of two **different major versions**:
  1. [Upgrade](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/os-version-upgrade#upgrade-your-service)
     to the latest major version.
  1. [Upgrade](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/os-version-upgrade#upgrade-your-service)
     to a minor version of the latest major version.

### Mandatory automatic upgrades

Although mandatory upgrades don't require your action, you can still
[run](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/os-version-upgrade#upgrade-your-service) them
yourself as soon as they become
[available](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/os-version-upgrade#available-or-upcoming-upgrades).
Otherwise, they are applied automatically during the
[maintenance window](/docs/platform/concepts/maintenance-window#maintenance-window).

- **Version patches**: `major.minor.patch1` > `major.minor.patch2`, for example,
  `2.17.1` > `2.17.2`
  - Scheduled and applied during your
    [maintenance window](/docs/platform/concepts/maintenance-window#maintenance-window)
  - Possible after any voluntary manual minor version upgrade to ensure the patch version
    consistency between the cluster nodes
- Cluster node version upgrades after **node replacements** in disaster recovery scenarios
  to ensure the version consistency between the cluster nodes
- Upgrades due to
  **[versions reaching end-of-life](/docs/platform/reference/eol-for-major-versions#aiven-for-opensearch)**
  on the Aiven Platform

## Before you start

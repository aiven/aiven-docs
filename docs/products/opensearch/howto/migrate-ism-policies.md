Reapply Index State Management (ISM) policies to Aiven for OpenSearch® using a script.

After restoring your snapshot, ISM policies that manage index rollover, retention, and
deletion must be reapplied to your indices. These policies are stored in the
`.opendistro-ism-config` index, but the assignments between indices and policies must
be reapplied using a script.

## What is restored

The `.opendistro-ism-config` index stores ISM policy configurations and is restored with
the snapshot, but policy assignments to specific indices are stored in the cluster
metadata and must be reapplied.

## Prerequisites

- A machine with network access to Aiven for OpenSearch services
- Python 3.11 or higher installed
- Ensure all data indices and the `.opendistro-ism-config` index are restored from the
  snapshot
- The snapshot was restored with `include_global_state: true`

:::warning

- **Snapshot must include global state**
  Ensure the snapshot was restored with `include_global_state: true`. If it was
  restored without the global state, the ISM policy assignments are not available in the
  cluster metadata, and the script fails to reapply the policies.

- **Script can only be run once**
  OpenSearch clears the cluster metadata with ISM policy assignments after the policies
  are applied. This means the script can only be run once.

:::

## Reapply ISM policies

The script retrieves the ISM policy assignments stored in the cluster state and
reapplies them to the corresponding indices.

To reapply ISM policies to indices in Aiven for OpenSearch:

1. Download the script from the
   [Aiven examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-examples/blob/main/solutions/reapply-ism-policies/avn-re-apply-ism-policies.py).

1. Create a JSON configuration file with the connection details for your Aiven for
   OpenSearch service. Use `avnadmin` as the `user` and replace `host`, `port`, and
   `password` with your service information:

   ```json
   {
       "host": "target-ip-or-fqdn",
       "port": target-port-number,
       "user": "avnadmin",
       "password": "the password"
   }
   ```

1. Once your configuration file is ready, run the script.

   ```bash
   python avn-re-apply-ism-policies.py --config path-to-config-file
   ```

## Monitor ISM task progress

Once ISM policies are reapplied, index lifecycle management tasks like rollovers,
retention, and deletion resume automatically. To monitor ISM task progress and ensure
policies are enforced correctly, run the following command and replace `SERVICE_URL`
with your Aiven for OpenSearch service's URL:

```bash
curl -X GET --insecure "$SERVICE_URL/_plugins/_ism/explain?pretty&size=100"=100"
```

Alternatively, you can verify the status of individual indices:

```bash
curl -X GET --insecure "$SERVICE_URL/_plugins/_ism/explain/<index_name>?pretty"
```

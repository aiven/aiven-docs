Aiven for OpenSearch lets you restore data from external OpenSearch or Elasticsearch snapshots, enabling migration from third-party repositories.

## Supported cloud providers

Aiven for OpenSearch supports snapshot restoration from these providers:

- Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- Amazon S3
- Microsoft Azure
- S3-compatible services, such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) or any other
  S3-compatible repository

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that:

- You have an active Aiven account with a configured project.
- A target Aiven for OpenSearch service within your project.
- Your OpenSearch or Elasticsearch snapshot is from version 7.10.2 or earlier, or
  from OpenSearch 1.x/2.x, and it is not newer than the target service version.
- Optional: Verify snapshot compatibility using the `pre_snapshot_checks.py` script from
  the
  [Aiven examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-examples/blob/main/solutions/validate-elasticsearch-to-opensearch-migration/pre_snapshot_checks.py).

:::note

When you create the snapshot, configure the following options:

- `restore_global_state`: Set to `true` to restore the cluster state, which includes
  important metadata like aliases and templates. Default is `false`. If the snapshot
  does not include the global state, setting this option to `true` has no effect.

- `include_aliases`: Set to `true` to restore aliases and their indices. Default is
  `true`.

For more details, see
[Reapply ISM policies after snapshot restore](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/migrate-ism-policies.md).
:::

### Optional: Collect data for migration validation {#collect-data-for-migration-validation}

You can collect and compare data from the source and target services to verify the
migration. This step is optional but recommended to ensure the migration
was successful.

1. **Collect data from the source service**: Before migration, collect data from
   the source service and save it in a JSON file
   (for example, `file1.json`). Use the following script from the
   [Aiven examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-examples/blob/main/solutions/validate-elasticsearch-to-opensearch-migration/get_migration_validation_data.py):

   ```bash
   python get_migration_validation_data.py \
   --patterns "YOUR_INDEX_PATTERNS" \
   --waitsec 30 \
   --outfile file1.json \
   --es_host https://YOUR_SOURCE_ES_HOST
   ```

1. **Collect data from the target service after migration**: After migration, collect
   data from the target Aiven for OpenSearch service and save it in
   a separate JSON file (for example, `file2.json`) using the same script:

   ```bash
   python get_migration_validation_data.py \
   --patterns "YOUR_INDEX_PATTERNS" \
   --waitsec 30 --outfile file2.json \
   --es_host https://YOUR_AIVEN_OPENSEARCH_HOST
   ```

1. **Compare data from the source and target services**: Use the `compare_migration_validation_data.py`
   script from the [Aiven examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-examples/blob/main/solutions/validate-elasticsearch-to-opensearch-migration/compare_migration_validation_data.py)
   to compare the two JSON files:

   ```bash
   python compare_migration_validation_data.py file1.json file2.json
   ```

## Configure snapshot migration settings

To start the migration, configure the `user-config` object in your
Aiven for OpenSearch service. The migration starts automatically once these settings are
applied.

Specify index patterns in the `indices` field of the `user-config` object to restore
specific indices from the snapshot. For details, see the
[Gather required parameters](#gather-required-parameters) section.

:::warning
Aiven for OpenSearch allows only one migration at a time. After data migration completes,
the backup process starts automatically. You cannot begin a new migration until
the backup process finishes.

You can either wait for the backup to finish or contact
[Aiven Support](mailto:support@aiven.io) to disable backups and start a new migration.

:::note
The restore callâs return value may be large and contain details that are not
immediately relevant. You can ignore it unless troubleshooting specific issues.
:::

## Monitor the migration

Check migration status using this API request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/PROJECT_NAME/service/SERVICE_NAME/migration" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN" | jq
```

Parameters:

- `PROJECT_NAME`: The name of your Aiven project.
- `SERVICE_NAME`: The name of your Aiven for OpenSearch service.

Use `jq` to format the JSON output for easier readability. If `jq` is not installed,
follow the [installation guide](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

If the migration configuration exists but has not started, the status
displays `"status": "waiting"`. After an attempt, the status shows the most recent
migration and includes a timestamp so you can track when it was last updated.

:::note
During the snapshot restore process, indices are temporarily closed and do not appear
in the user interface. They reopen once the restore is complete.
:::

### Retry the migration

To retry the migration, use this API request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/PROJECT_NAME/service/SERVICE_NAME/opensearch/migration" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN" \
-d '{"command": "retry"}'
```

### Check snapshot status

To monitor the snapshot process, use this API request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/PROJECT_NAME/service/SERVICE_NAME/opensearch/snapshot-status" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN" | jq
```

The response shows the snapshot status and details if a snapshot is in progress:

```json
{
  "status": {
    "in_progress": true,
    "details": {
      "snapshot_name": "name-of-the-snapshot",
      "started": "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ",
      "shards": {
        "done": number-of-completed-shards,
        "total": total-number-of-shards
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `details` section is included only if a snapshot is in progress.

## Finalize the migration process

After the restoration process is complete, Aiven for OpenSearch automatically deletes
the snapshot repository used during the migration to clean up resources.

### Reapply ISM policies and security configurations

Reapply necessary configurations:

- **Reapply ISM policies**: Reapply Index State Management (ISM) policies to the
  restored indices. For more information, see
  [Reapply ISM policies after snapshot restore](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/migrate-ism-policies).

- **Update security configurations**: Review and reconfigure security settings,
  including OpenDistro security configurations. For more details, see
  [Migrate OpenDistro security configuration](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/migrate-opendistro-security-config-aiven).

### Verify the migration

Ensure that your data has been restored successfully by listing the indices and checking
the document count for your migrated data.

If you have followed
[collect data for migration validation](#collect-data-for-migration-validation), you
can compare data from both the source and target services as part of the
verification process.

### Script-based validation

To verify migration results, run the `compare_migration_validation_data.py` script
from [Aiven examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-examples/blob/main/solutions/validate-elasticsearch-to-opensearch-migration/compare_migration_validation_data.py)
to compare indices, document counts, aliases, and ISM policies between two datasets.

```bash
python compare_migration_validation_data.py file1.json file2.json
```

### Command-based validation

To verify indices in your Aiven for OpenSearch service, run the following command,
replacing `SERVICE_URL` with your service's URL:

```bash
curl $SERVICE_URL/_cat/indices?v&expand_wildcards=all
```

To view all aliases for your indices, run:

```bash
curl $SERVICE_URL/_cat/aliases?v&expand_wildcards=all
```

Compare the outputs from the source and target services to ensure that document
counts and aliases match after the migration.

## Backup management during migration

**Automatic pausing of backups**: During the migration process, Aiven for OpenSearch
automatically pauses regular backups to prevent any potential conflicts with the
migration.

**Automatic resumption of backups**: After the migration is complete, Aiven for
OpenSearch automatically resumes regular backup operations.

## Error handling

During the migration process, you can encounter issues such as:

- **Validation errors**: Ensure inputs like `snapshot_name`, `base_path`, and URLs
  are properly formatted.
- **Common issues**: Address common errors such as missing credentials, incorrect paths,
  or unsupported snapshot versions.

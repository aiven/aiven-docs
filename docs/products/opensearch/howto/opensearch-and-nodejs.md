title: Write search queries with OpenSearch¬Æ and NodeJS
---

Learn how the OpenSearch¬Æ JavaScript client gives a clear and useful
interface to communicate with an OpenSearch cluster and run search
queries. To make it more delicious we'll be using a recipe dataset from
Kaggle.

## Prepare the playground

You can create an OpenSearch cluster either with the visual interface or
with the command line. Depending on your preference follow the
instructions for
[getting started with the console for Aiven for Opensearch](/docs/products/opensearch/get-started) or see
[how to create a service with the help of Aiven command line interface](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli).

:::note
You can also clone the final demo project from [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/aiven/demo-open-search-node-js).
:::

### File structure and GitHub repository

To organise our development space we'll use these files:

-   `config.js` to keep necessary basis to connect to the cluster,
-   `index.js` to hold methods which manipulate the index,
-   `helpers.js` to contain utilities for logging responses,
-   `search.js` for methods specific to search requests.

we'll be adding code into these files and running the methods from the
command line.

### Connect to the cluster and load data

Follow instructions on how to
[connect to the cluster with a NodeJS client](connect-with-nodejs) and add the necessary code to `config.js`. Once you're
connected
[load a sample data set](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/sample-dataset#load-data-with-nodejs) and
[retrieve the data mapping](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/sample-dataset#get-mapping-with-nodejs) to understand the structure of the created index.

### Extra helpers

To render the response, add the following helper method to your
`helpers.js` file.

```javascript
/**
 * Parsing and logging list of titles from the result, used in callbacks.
 */
const logTitles = (error, result) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    const hits = result.body.hits.hits;
    console.log(`Number of returned results is ${hits.length}`);
    console.log(hits.map(hit => hit._source.title));
  }
};
```

:::note
In the code snippets we'll keep error handling somewhat simple and use
`console.log` to print information into the terminal.
:::

Now you're ready to start querying the data.

## Query the data

Now that we have data in the OpenSearch cluster, we're ready to
construct and run search queries. We will use `search` method which is
provided by the OpenSearch JavaScript client. The following code goes
into `search.js`, you'll need connection configuration and helpers
methods. Therefore, include them at the top of your `search.js` file
with

```javascript
const { client, indexName } = require("./config");
const { logTitles } = require("./helpers");
```

The `search` method expects three optional parameters: `params`,
`options` and `callback`.

The query details are into the `params` object, which contains the name of the index
(`index`), the maximum number of results to be returned (`size`), if the
response is paginated (`size` and `from`), by which fields to sort the
data (`sort`) and others.

we'll pay a closer attention to two of these parameters - `q` - a query
defined in the Lucene query string syntax and `body` - a query based on
Query DSL (Domain Specific Language). These are two main methods to
construct a query.

The query string syntax is a powerful tool which can be used for a
variety of requests. It is especially convenient for cURL requests,
since it is a very compact string. However, as the complexity of a
request grows, it becomes more difficult to read and maintain these
types of queries.
<!-- vale on -->

```javascript
//example of using a query syntax
client.search({
    index: 'recipes',
    q: 'ingredients:broccoli AND calories:(>=100 AND <200)'
})
```

A query with a request `body` might look bulky at first glance, but its
structure makes it easier to read, understand and modify the content.
Unlike `q`, which expects a string, `body` is an object allowing a
variety of granular parameters.

```javascript
//example of using a request body
 client.search({
     index: indexName,
     body: {
         query: {
             match: { property: 'value' }
         }
     }
 })
```

Let's focus on Query DSL and its three main groups of
requests: term-level, full-text and boolean. You will also see how to
use the Lucene query string syntax inside Query DSL.

-   Term-level queries are handy when we need to find **exact matches**
    for numbers, dates or tags and don't need to sort the results by
    relevance. Term-level queries use search terms as they are without
    additional analysis.
-   Full-text queries allow a smarter search for matches in analysed
    text fields and return results sorted by relevance.
-   Boolean queries are useful to combine multiple queries together. It
    supports boolean clauses such as `must`, `filter`, `should` and
    `must_not`.

### Find matching field values

One of the examples of a term-level query is searching for all entries
containing a particular value in a field. To construct a body request we
use `term` property which defines an object, where the name is a field
and the value is a term we\'re searching in this field.

```javascript
/**
 * Searching for exact matches of a value in a field.
 * run-func search term sodium 0
 */
module.exports.term = (field, value) => {
  console.log(`Searching for values in the field ${field} equal to ${value}`);
  const body = {
    query: {
      term: {
        [field]: value,
      },
    },
  };
  client.search(
    {
      index: indexName,
      body,
    },
    logTitles
  );
};
```

```
run-func search term sodium 0
```

Try to replace \"sodium\" with other fields we have, such as
\"calories\" or \"fat\".

### Find fields with a value within a range

When dealing with numeric values, naturally we want to be able to search
for certain ranges of values. To find all documents that contain terms
in a specific field within a given range, use `range` property. It
expects an object, where the name is set to the field name and the body
defines the upper and lower bounds: `gt` (greater than), `gte` (greater
than or equal to), `lt` (less than) and `lte` (less than or equal to).

```javascript
/**
 * Searching for a range of values in a field.
 * run-func search range sodium 0 10
 */
module.exports.range = (field, gte, lte) => {
  console.log(
    `Searching for values in the ${field} ranging from ${gte} to ${lte}`
  );
  const body = {
    query: {
      range: {
        [field]: {
          gte,
          lte,
        },
      },
    },
  };
  client.search(
    {
      index: indexName,
      body,
    },
    logTitles
  );
};
```

```
run-func search range sodium 0 10
```

Try your own term query. How about a search for food with a particular
rating value, or finding all meals with zero calories?

### Find fields with fuzzy text matching

When searching for terms inside text fields, we can take into account
typos and misspellings. We measure such \"deviations\" by a minimum
number of single-character edits necessary to convert one word into
another. Such types of queries are called `fuzzy` and the property
`fuzziness` specifies the maximum edit distance.

```javascript
/**
 * Specifying fuzziness to account for typos and misspelling.
 * run-func search fuzzy title pinapple 2
 */
module.exports.fuzzy = (field, value, fuzziness) => {
  console.log(
    `Search for ${value} in the ${field} with fuzziness set to ${fuzziness}`
  );
  const query = {
    query: {
      fuzzy: {
        [field]: {
          value,
          fuzziness,
        },
      },
    },
  };
  client.search(
    {
      index: indexName,
      body: query,
    },
    logTitles
  );
};
```
<!-- vale off -->
See if you can find recipes with misspelled pineapple üçç
<!-- vale on -->

```
run-func search fuzzy title pinapple 2
```

Even though there is a typo in the word \"pineapple\", you still got
relevant results. Try other search terms and different values for
`fuzziness` to understand better how fuzzy queries work. What is your
favourite food ingredient typo?

### Find best match with multiple search words

A standard way to perform a full-text query is to use `match` property
inside a request. `match` expects an object, the name of which is set to
a specific field, and its body contains a search query in a form of a
string.

To see `match` in action use the method below to search for \"Tomato
garlic soup with dill\".

```javascript
/**
 * Finding matches sorted by relevance.
 * run-func search match title 'Tomato-garlic soup with dill'
 */
module.exports.match = (field, query) => {
  console.log(`Searching for ${query} in the field ${field}`);
  const body = {
    query: {
      match: {
        [field]: {
          query,
        },
      },
    },
  };
  client.search(
    {
      index: indexName,
      body,
    },
    logTitles
  );
};
```

```
run-func search match title 'Tomato-garlic soup with dill'
```

In the response you should see different recipes of soups sorted by how
close they are to \"Tomato-garlic soup with dill\" according to
OpenSearch engine.

What are your favourite recipes? Try searching for them and see if you
find some new and unusual recipe combinations.

### Find matching phrases

When the order of the words is important, use `match_phrase` instead of
`match`. An additional power of `match_phrase` is that it allows to
define how far search words can be from each other to still be
considered a match. This parameter is called `slop` and its default
value is `0`. The format of `match_phrase` is almost identical to
`match`:

```javascript
/**
 * Specifying a slop - a distance between search words.
 * run-func search slop directions "pizza pineapple" 10
 */
module.exports.slop = (field, query, slop) => {
  console.log(
    `Searching for ${query} with slop value ${slop} in the field ${field}`
  );
  const body = {
    query: {
      match_phrase: {
        [field]: {
          query,
          slop,
        },
      },
    },
  };
  client.search(
    {
      index: indexName,
      body,
    },
    logTitles
  );
};
```

We can use this method to find some recipes for pizza with pineapple. I
learned from my Italian colleague that this considered a combination
only for tourists, not a true pizza recipe. we'll do it by searching
the `directions` field for words \"pizza\" and \"pineapple\" with
top-most distance of 10 words in between.

```
run-func search slop directions "pizza pineapple" 10
```

Oh look: \"Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza\" (don't tell my colleague).

So far all the requests we tried returned us at most 10 results. Why 10?
Because it is a default `size` value. It can be increased by setting
`size` property to a higher number when making the request. we'll
include this in the next example.

### Search with query string syntax

Remember the Lucene query string syntax we talked about earlier, in
relation to `q` parameter? We can also use it inside of Query DSL by
defining `query_string` object. It requires its own `query` parameter
and, optionally, we can specify `default_field` or `fields` properties
to indicate the search fields.

This example also sets `size` to demonstrate how we can get more than 10
results.

```javascript
/**
 * Using special operators within a query string and a size parameter.
 * run-func search query ingredients "(salmon|tuna) +tomato -onion" 100
 */
module.exports.query = (field, query, size) => {
  console.log(
    `Searching for ${query} in the field ${field} and returning maximum ${size} results`
  );
  const body = {
    query: {
      query_string: {
        default_field: field,
        query,
      },
    },
  };
  client.search(
    {
      index: indexName,
      body,
      size,
    },
    logTitles
  );
};
```

To find recipes with tomato, salmon or tuna and no onion run this query:

```
run-func search query ingredients "(salmon|tuna) +tomato -onion" 100
```

Now, experiment with your recipe search by including and excluding
different ingredients.

### Combine queries to improve results

The boolean clause types each affect the document relevance score
differently. Both `must` and `should` positively contribute to the
score, affecting the relevance of matches; `must_not` sets the score to
0, ensuring that the document won't appear in the results. `filter`
clause is similar to `must`, however it has no effect on the relevance
score.

In the next method we combine what we learned so far, using both
term-level and full-search queries to find recipes to make a quick and
easy dish, with no garlic, low sodium and high protein.

```javascript
/**
 * Combining several queries together
 * run-func search boolean
 */
module.exports.boolean = () => {
  console.log(
    `Searching for quick and easy recipes without garlic with low sodium and high protein`
  );
  const body = {
    query: {
      bool: {
        must: { match: { categories: "Quick & Easy" } },
        must_not: { match: { ingredients: "garlic" } },
        filter: [
          { range: { sodium: { lte: 50 } } },
          { range: { protein: { gte: 5 } } },
        ],
      },
    },
  };
  client.search(
    {
      index: indexName,
      body,
    },
    logTitles
  );
};
```

```
run-func search boolean
```

Now create your own boolean query, using
what we learned to find recipes with particular nutritional values and
ingredients. Experiment using different clauses to see how they affects
the results.

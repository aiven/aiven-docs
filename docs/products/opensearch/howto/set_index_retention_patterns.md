title: Set index retention patterns
---

This article describes how to configure the maximum number of indices to
keep in your Aiven for OpenSearch® instance. For more information on
OpenSearch® indices and shards, see
[this article](/docs/products/opensearch/concepts/indices).

To create cleanup patterns for OpenSearch indices:

1.  Log in to the [Aiven web console](https://console.aiven.io) and
    select your service.

2.  Select **Indexes** from the left sidebar.

    The **Indexes** section lists the patterns that are currently in
    use.

3.  Select **Add pattern**.

4.  Enter the pattern to use and the maximum index count
    for the pattern, then select **Create**.

Alternatively, you can use our [API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/) with a
request similar to the following:

```
curl -X PUT --data '{"user_config":{"index_patterns": [{"pattern": "logs*", "max_index_count": 2},{"pattern":"test.?", "max_index_count": 3}]}' header "content-type: application-json" --header "authorization: aivenv1 <YOUR TOKEN HERE>" https://api.aiven.io/v1beta/project/<project>/service/<service_name>
```

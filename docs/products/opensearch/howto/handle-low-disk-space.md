title: Handle low disk space
---

OpenSearchÂ® relies on [watermarks](/docs/products/opensearch/reference/low-space-watermarks) to respond to low disk space.

When you're running low on disk space using Aiven for OpenSearch, you
can take one of these actions:

-   Upgrade to a larger plan from with a help of [Aiven
    console](https://console.aiven.io/) or by using [Aiven CLI
    client](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client).
-   Clean up unnecessary indices. For logs, it is often beneficial
    to create a separate, daily indices, allowing easy and efficient
    clean-up of the oldest data.

## Follow-up actions after cleaning space

If `low watermark` or `high watermark` thresholds are exceeded, but data
is eventually cleaned up, no further action is needed, as OpenSearch
will continue allowing writes. However, if `flood_state watermark` is
exceeded, **you must manually unset** `read_only_allow_delete` **for
each affected index**. This can be done by updating index settings:

```bash
curl https://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/INDEX_NAME/_settings \
-X PUT \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null}'
```

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

| Variable     | Description                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `USER`       | User name to use when accessing the OpenSearch cluster |
| `PASSWORD`   | Password to use when accessing the OpenSearch cluster  |
| `HOST`       | Host name for the connection                           |
| `PORT`       | Port number for the connection                         |
| `INDEX_NAME` | Name of the index                                      |

:::warning
This needs to be done separately for each index that was marked as
read-only by OpenSearch.
:::

:::note
Aiven does not automatically unset this option to ensure no flipping
around read-only and read-write state.

title: Enable OpenID Connect authentication on Aiven for OpenSearch®
---

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol that builds on top
of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It provides a simple and secure way to verify
the identity of a user and obtain basic profile information about them.

## Prerequisites

-   Aiven for OpenSearch® version 2 or later is required. If you are
    using an earlier version, upgrade to the latest version.
-   OpenSearch Security management must be
    [enabled](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/enable-opensearch-security) on the Aiven for OpenSearch® service.
-   An OpenID provider (IdP) that supports the OpenID Connect protocol.

## Requirements to enable OpenID Connect

To enable OpenID Connect authentication for Aiven for OpenSearch, you
must configure OpenID Connect with an Identity Provider (IdP). Aiven for
OpenSearch integrates with various OpenID Connect IdPs, and the exact
steps to achieve this differ depending on your chosen IdP. Refer to your
Identity Provider's official documentation for specific configuration
steps. To successfully set up OpenID Connect authentication, the
following parameters from your IdP:

-   **IdP URL**: The URL of your Identity Provider (IdP), which will be
    used to authenticate users.
-   **Client ID**: Credentials your IdP provides when registering Aiven
    for OpenSearch as a client application. This credential is used to
    authenticate your Aiven for OpenSearch client application against
    the IdP and facilitate secure communication.
-   **Client Secret**: Credentials your IdP provides when you register
    Aiven for OpenSearch as a client application.
-   **Scope**: The scope of the authentication request specifies the
    permissions to request from the Identity Provider
    (IdP). The available and required scopes may vary depending on the
    IdP you are using. Some common scopes include `openid`, `profile`,
    `email`.
-   **Roles key and subject key**: Keys that help Aiven for OpenSearch
    Dashboards understand which part of the returned token contains role
    information and which part contains the user's identity or name.

:::note
The **Redirect URL** is automatically generated and available in the
Aiven Console. This is the URL to which the Identity Provider (IdP) will
redirect users after successful authentication. For more information on
how to obtain this URL, see the next section.

## Enable OpenID Connect authentication via Aiven Console

1.  In the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), access your Aiven
    for OpenSearch service where you want to enable OpenID Connect.
2.  Select **Users** from the left sidebar.
3.  In the **SSO authentication** section, use the **Add method**
    drop-down and select **OpenID**.
4.  On **Configure OpenID Connect authentication** screen,
    -   **Redirect URL**: This URL is auto-populated. It is the URL that
        users will be redirected to after they have successfully
        authenticated through the IdP.
    -   **IdP URL**: Enter the URL of your OpenID Connect Identity
        Provider. This is the URL that Aiven will use to redirect users
        to your IdP for authentication.
    -   **Client ID**: Enter the ID you obtained during your IdP
        registration. This ID is used to authenticate your Aiven
        application with your IdP.
    -   **Client Secret**: Enter the secret associated with the Client
        ID. This secret is used to encrypt communications between your
        Aiven application and your IdP.
    -   **Scope**: The scope of the claims. This is the set of
        permissions that you are requesting from your IdP. For example,
        you can request the `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes to
        get the user's identity, profile information, and email
        address.
    -   **Roles key**: The key in the returned JSON that stores the
        user's roles. This key is used by Aiven to determine the
        user's permissions.
    -   **Subject key**: This refers to the specific key within the
        returned JSON that holds the user's name or identifying
        subject. Aiven uses this key to recognize and authenticate the
        user. By default, this key is labeled as `Subject`.
5.  **Enable advanced configuration** (Optional) to further fine-tune
    the authentication process. Aiven for OpenSearch provides the
    following advanced configuration options:
    -   **Token handling**: Choose your preferred method for handling
        the authentication token.
        -   **HTTP Header**: The authentication token is passed in an
            HTTP header.
            -   **Header name**: Enter the specific name of the HTTP
                header that will contain the authentication token. The
                default header name is Authorization.
        -   **URL parameter**: The authentication token is passed as a
            URL parameter. You can specify the parameter name.
            -   **Parameter name**: Enter the specific URL parameter
                that will carry the authentication token.
    -   **Refresh limit count**: Maximum number of unrecognized JWT key
        IDs allowed within 10 seconds. Enter the value for the Refresh
        Limit Count parameter. The default value is 10.
    -   **Refresh limit window (ms)**: This is the interval, measured in
        milliseconds, during which the system will verify unrecognized
        JWT key IDs. Enter the value for the Refresh Limit Window
        parameter. The default value is 10,000 (10 seconds).
6.  Select **Enable** to complete the setup and activate the
    configuration.

import HostMetrics from "@site/static/includes/host-metrics.md";

Monitor and optimize your Aiven for OpenSearch service with metrics available via Prometheus. These metrics provide insights into cluster health, replication status, and overall performance.

## Access metrics

You can access these metrics via Prometheus, integrated with Telegraf. For instructions,
see [Prometheus integration](/docs/platform/howto/integrations/prometheus-metrics).

## OpenSearch-specific metrics

The following metrics are specific to Aiven for OpenSearch and offer detailed insights
into the state and performance of your OpenSearch service.

### Node statistics

Provides metrics for each node, including CPU and memory usage, disk I/O, and
JVM statistics. For more information, see the
[node stats API](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/nodes-apis/nodes-stats/).

### Cluster statistics

Aggregates cluster-level metrics, such as the number of indices, shard distribution,
and memory usage. For more information, see the
[cluster stats API](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/cluster-api/cluster-stats/).

### Cluster health

Monitors the health of the cluster, with granular metrics available at the index level.
Use `local` with `level=index` to view index-specific health status.
For more information, see
the [cluster health API](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/cluster-api/cluster-health/).

### Cross-cluster replication (CCR) stats

- **Leader stats:** Tracks replication metrics from the leader cluster, such as
  replication lag and index synchronization status. For more information, see
  the [leader cluster stats API](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/replication-plugin/api/#get-leader-cluster-stats).
- **Follower stats:** Tracks metrics for the follower cluster, including replication
  delays and error rates, to ensure data consistency. For more information, see the
  [follower cluster stats API](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/replication-plugin/api/#get-follower-cluster-stats).

### Accessing metrics
You can view these metrics via Prometheus, which Aiven integrates with Telegraf. For
information on setting up Prometheus, see [Prometheus integration](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/prometheus-integration).

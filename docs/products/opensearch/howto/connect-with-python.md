title: Connect to OpenSearch® cluster with Python
---

You can interact with your cluster with the help of the [Python
OpenSearch®
client](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py). It
provides a convenient syntax to send commands to your OpenSearch
cluster. Follow its `README` file for installation instructions.

To connect with your cluster, you need the **Service URI** of your
OpenSearch cluster. You can find the connection details in the section
**Overview** on [Aiven web console](https://console.aiven.io).
Alternatively, you can retrieve it via the `avn service get` command
with the [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn_service_get).
Notice that `service_uri` contains credentials; therefore, should be
treated with care.

The **Service URI** has information in the following format:

```bash
[](https://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port)
```

For security reasons is recommended to use environment variables to save
your credential information. You can use the `dotenv` [Python
library](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to manage your
environment variables. Follow its `README` file for installation
instructions.

After is installed, you need to create `.env` file in the root directory
of your project with the `SERVICE_URI` on it:

```
SERVICE_URI=[https://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port](https://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port)
```

And import it in your Python script.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
SERVICE_URI = os.getenv("SERVICE_URI")
```

Now, you can use it as a string variable saved in the `SERVICE_URI`.

You can import OpenSearch and create an instance of the class to connect
with your cluster. In this example, we will be giving the full path and
enabling the `use_ssl` to secure our connection.

```python
from opensearchpy import OpenSearch
opensearch = OpenSearch(SERVICE_URI, use_ssl=True)
```

:::note
There are other ways that you can create your OpenSearch instance
configuring parameters such as `verify_certs`, `ssl_assert_hostname` and
others authentication details that can be configured.

Check
[documentation](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py) for
more details.

Those are the steps to create a Python OpenSearch client class instance
that can be used to perform request operations and send responses to
your cluster.

title: Get started with Dev tools
---

Similarly to how you can work with the OpenSearchÂ® service
[using cURL](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/opensearch-with-curl) you can run the queries directly from OpenSearch Dashboards
**Dev Tools**. The console contains both a request editor and a command
output window.

To get you started, check out the various examples of requests that are
included below. You can see that these are same requests as in our
article
[on how to use cURL](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/opensearch-with-curl), but in a pure [DSL query
form](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/index/).
This interface is helpful when you want to quickly populate index with
sample data, or run a test query.

Use **POST** method to add a new item to an index called
`shopping-list`. If the index doesn't exist yet, it will be created:

```
POST shopping-list/_doc
{
   "item": "apple",
   "quantity": 2
}
```

Follow by adding another item with a different set of fields:

```
POST shopping-list/_doc
{
    "item": "bucket",
    "color": "blue",
    "quantity": 5,
    "notes": "the one with the metal handle"
}
```

You can see the command output after running the query describing
created item:

```
{
  "_index" : "shopping-list",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "jKTeWH0BMffxqtFft8Zv",
  "_version" : 1,
  "result" : "created",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 1,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```

Use **GET** method to send a query to find items with an apple:

```
GET _search
{
    "query": {
        "multi_match" : {
            "query" : "apple",
            "fields" : ["item", "notes"]
        }
    }
}
```

In the output you can see the full response from OpenSearch engine:

```
{
  "took" : 35,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 9,
    "successful" : 9,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.6931471,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "shopping-list",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "i6TdWH0BMffxqtFf7cZv",
        "_score" : 0.6931471,
        "_source" : {
          "item" : "apple",
          "quantity" : 2
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Additionally, you can navigate through the history of queries and run
them again.

:::note
**Dev Tools** supports keyboard shortcuts, to see the full list of
supported commands open the help panel, which you can find as part of
the menu.

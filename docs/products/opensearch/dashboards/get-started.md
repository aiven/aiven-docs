title: Get started
---

To start using **Aiven for OpenSearch速 Dashboards**,
[create Aiven for OpenSearch速 service first](/docs/products/opensearch/get-started) and OpenSearch Dashboards service will be added alongside
it. Once the Aiven for OpenSearch service is running you can find
connection information to your OpenSearch Dashboards in the service
overview page and use your favourite browser to access OpenSearch
Dashboards service.

:::note
Starting with Aiven for OpenSearch速 versions 1.3.13 and 2.10, OpenSearch
Dashboards will remain available during a maintenance update that also
consists of version updates to your Aiven for OpenSearch service.

## Load sample data

OpenSearch Dashboards come with three demonstration datasets included.
To add sample data follow these steps:

1.  On the OpenSearch Dashboards landing page click **Add sample
    data**.
2.  Choose one of the available datasets and click **Add data**.
3.  Click **View data** to open the dashboard.

## Tools and pages

OpenSearch Dashboards have many tools and features for working with data
and running queries. Here are a few ideas to get you started in each of
the different sections.

### Discover

**Discover** page provides an interface to work with available data
fields and run search queries by using either [the OpenSearch Dashboards
Query Language
(DQL)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/dql/) or [Apache
Lucene速](https://lucene.apache.org/).

Additionally to search queries, you can filter the data by using either
a visual interface or [OpenSearch Query
DSL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/index/)

:::tip
If the index you're looking at contains a date field, pay attention to
the currently selected date range when running a query.
:::

### Visualize

**Visualize** page is an interface to create and manage your
visualisations. In order to create a new visualization:

1.  Select visualization type you want to use.
2.  Choose the source of data.
3.  Follow the interface to set up metrics and buckets.

### Dashboard

A set of visualization can be put together on a single dashboard. Search
queries and filters applied to the dashboard will refine results for
every included visualisation.

### Dev tools console

Read how you can use **Dev Tools** to run the queries directly from
OpenSearch Dashboards
[in a separate article](howto/dev-tools-usage-example) .

### Query Workbench

Query Workbench allows you to use SQL syntax instead of DSL to query the
data. For example, you can retrieve the items we just added to the
shopping list with:

```sql
select * from shopping-list
```

Find more on how to work [with SQL
Workbench](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/workbench/)
and [how to run SQL
queries](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/index/)
in the official documentation.

OpenSearch® Dashboards is both a visualisation tool for data in the cluster and a user interface for OpenSearch plugins.
It's included with your Aiven for OpenSearch service and accessible through the browser.

:::note
- OpenSearch Dashboards was forked in 2021 from the formerly open source
  project Kibana.

- Starting with Aiven for OpenSearch® versions 1.3.13 and 2.10, OpenSearch
  Dashboards will remain available during a maintenance update that also
  consists of version updates to your Aiven for OpenSearch service.
:::

OpenSearch Dashboards is ideal for data visualisation and monitoring. It
allows building dashboards using visual tools and provides an interface
to run DSL and SQL queries.

title: Get Started with Aiven for OpenSearch速
---

To start using Aiven for OpenSearch速, the first step is to create a
service. You can do this on the [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) or with the [Aiven
CLI](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client).

This quickstart section provides the steps to create an Aiven for
OpenSearch速 service.

## Create an Aiven for OpenSearch速 service

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
2.  Follow
    [these instructions](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service) to create a new Aiven for OpenSearch service.

Once the service is ready, the status changes to *Running*. Depending on
your selected cloud provider and region, this generally takes a couple
of minutes.

## Access OpenSearch Dashboards

When you create an Aiven for OpenSearch service, you will automatically
get access to OpenSearch Dashboards. This enables you to quickly and
easily visualize data from your OpenSearch service with minimal effort.

To access OpenSearch Dashboards, follow these steps:

1.  On the **Overview** page of your Aiven for OpenSearch service, click
    **OpenSearch Dashboards**.
2.  Copy or click the Service URI to open OpenSearch Dashboards in
    your browser.
3.  Enter the username and password from the connection information
    screen when prompted.
4.  Click **Sign In** to view the OpenSearch Dashboards.

After logging in, you can explore and interact with your data, as well
as add sample data and utilize OpenSearch API features.

For more information, see
[OpenSearch Dashboards](/docs/products/opensearch/dashboards) section.

To start working with your data in OpenSearch, you need to first connect
to your service. A good starting point is to learn how to
[connect with cURL](howto/opensearch-with-curl). You can find the necessary connection details in the
service overview.

---

Before enabling OpenSearch Security management for Aiven for OpenSearch
service, it is crucial to be aware of its impact on your current system
and adapt your infrastructure accordingly. This document highlights
essential aspects to consider before enabling it.

## Test OpenSearch® Security management

If you are an existing Aiven for OpenSearch user, testing OpenSearch
Security management before applying it to your running services is
advisable. To do this, you have two options:

1.  [Create a new service](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service) for testing purposes.
2.  [Fork](/docs/platform/concepts/service-forking) one of your existing running services to create a test
    environment.

## Enabling OpenSearch® Security management

Once OpenSearch Security management is enabled, the following changes
will occur:

1.  Your current Aiven for OpenSearch users and roles will be
    transferred to OpenSearch.
2.  Aiven for OpenSearch Access Control List (ACL) APIs will be
    deactivated. The affected API endpoints are:
    -   [ServiceOpenSearchAclGet](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#tag/Service:_OpenSearch/operation/ServiceOpenSearchAclGet)
    -   [ServiceOpenSearchAclSet](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#tag/Service:_OpenSearch/operation/ServiceOpenSearchAclSet)
    -   [ServiceOpenSearchAclUpdate](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#tag/Service:_OpenSearch/operation/ServiceOpenSearchAclUpdate)
3.  Aiven for OpenSearch ACL in Aiven Terraform provider will be
    disabled. The affected resources are:
    -   [Opensearch_acl_config](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs/resources/opensearch_acl_config)
    -   [Opensearch_acl_rule](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs/resources/opensearch_acl_rule)
    -   [Opensearch_user](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs/resources/opensearch_user)
4.  Managing OpenSearch ACL through the [Aiven
    Console](https://console.aiven.io/) will no longer be available.
    Instead, use the OpenSearch API and OpenSearch Security dashboard
    for user and role management.

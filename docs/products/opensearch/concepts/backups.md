Aiven for OpenSearch® databases are automatically backed up,
[encrypted](/docs/platform/concepts/cloud-security), and stored securely in object storage. Backups are stored
in the same region as the main service nodes.

Depending on the service plan, we offer single backups for disaster
recovery or daily backups with different retention periods:

-   Hobbyist plans: single backup for disaster recovery
-   Startup plans: daily backups with a 2-day retention period
-   Business plans: daily backups with a 14-day retention period
-   Premium plans: daily backups with a 30-day retention period

To allow returning to an earlier point in time, Aiven for OpenSearch
uses two kinds of backups - hourly and daily. Each type has its own
backup frequency interval and retention period. Currently, you cannot
configure these settings.

:::note
Aiven for OpenSearch currently only supports restoring from daily
backups or hourly backups from the previous day.

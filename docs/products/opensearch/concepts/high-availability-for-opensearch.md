Aiven for OpenSearch® is available on a variety of plans, offering
different levels of high availability. The selected plan defines the
features available, and a summary is provided in the table below:

| Plan         | High Availability Features                                  | Backup History                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Hobbyist** | Single-node with limited availability                       | single backup for disaster recovery      |
| **Startup**  | Single-node with limited availability                       | 2 days, with hourly backup for 24 hours  |
| **Business** | Three-node cluster configured for high availability         | 14 days, with hourly backup for 24 hours |
| **Premium**  | Six-node (or more) cluster configured for high availability | 30 days, with hourly backup for 24 hours |

## Failure handling

**Minor failures**, such as service process crashes or temporary loss of
network access, are handled by Aiven automatically in all plans without
any major changes to the service deployment. The service automatically
restores normal operation once the crashed process is automatically
restarted or when the network access is restored.

**Severe failures**, such as loss of a cluster node, require more
drastic recovery measures. Aiven platform continuously monitors the
health of every node in a cluster. When a node reports failures from its
own self-diagnostics or when no response to a health check is returned,
Aiven platform starts a replacement node. While the node is being
replaced, client requests are rerouted to the other nodes that have
replica shards. When the new node joins the cluster, it restores data
from the existing nodes or from a backup if no old nodes can be reached
anymore, and starts servicing requests when data restoration is
completed.

## High Availability in Business and Premium plans

To achieve high availability in business and premium plans, Aiven for
OpenSearch configures your indices to have at least one replica. You
will want to choose a cloud region with at least three availability
zones to ensure that the primary and replica shards will not be down at
the same time. The setting that controls the replication factor in index
settings is called `number_of_replicas`. Having its value as 1 is enough
to have your data resilient to an outage in a single zone, and setting
it to higher values will add tolerance for more availability zone
failures.

Cluster nodes in business and premium plans are distributed evenly
across availability zones in a cloud region. Moreover, each node is
configured to be aware of its zone. Therefore a primary copy of your
data and a replica copy will be allocated on the nodes in different
availability zones.

Aiven platform constantly monitors all nodes in an OpenSearch cluster.
When a node stops responding to a health check for sufficiently long
time, Aiven platform starts a replacement node, waits for the node to
start, and replaces the failed node with the new node in the
cluster's configuration.

:::note
The amount of time it takes for a new node to become fully operational
depends mainly on the used cloud region and the amount of data that
needs to be copied from primary shards. However, in a multi-node cluster
on a Business or Premium plan all the nodes with in-sync shards will
keep responding to client requests even before the new node is fully
operational. Moreover, for every primary shard on the lost node, the
cluster promotes one in-sync replica shard. Write requests from the
clients will be routed to the promoted shards. All of this is automatic
and requires no administrator intervention.

## Single-node Hobbyist and Startup service plans

Losing the only node from the service starts the automatic process of
creating a new replacement node. The new node starts up, restores its
state from the latest available backup and resumes serving customers.
Since there was just a single node providing the service, the service
will be unavailable for the duration of the restore operation. All the
write operations made since the last backup are lost.

title: OpenSearch速 vs Elasticsearch
---

OpenSearch速 is the open-source version of the Elasticsearch project, which has [a restrictive license](https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change). Third parties cannot offer Elasticsearch as a service.

The community (including Aiven) joined
forces to create and maintain OpenSearch based on the last open source
licensed releases of both Elasticsearch and Kibana (v7.10.2).

Version 1.0 release of OpenSearch should be very similar to the
Elasticsearch release that it is based on, and Aiven encourages all
customers to upgrade at their earliest convenience. This is to ensure
that your platforms can continue to receive upgrades in the future.

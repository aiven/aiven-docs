Alongside the search functionality, OpenSearchÂ® offers a powerful
analytics engine able to perform summary calculations of your data, and
extract statistics and metrics very rapidly. Results of these
\"aggregations\" can be then visualised with OpenSearch Dashboards.

Aggregations can be divided into three groups:

-   **metric aggregation** performs simple calculations on values
    extracted from the fields of the documents, for example finding
    minimum or maximum value, calculating average or collecting
    statistics about field values.
-   **bucket aggregation** distributes documents over a set of buckets
    based on provided criteria. For example, based on predefined ranges
    of values or based on how often a value is encountered in a field.
    Bucket aggregation is also used to create histograms.
-   **pipeline aggregations** combine several aggregations in a way that
    allows using a result of one aggregation as an intermediate step to
    create a refined output. With pipeline aggregations you can build
    moving averages, cumulative sums and perform a variety of other
    mathematical calculations over the data in your documents.

OpenSearch Security is a powerful feature that enhances the security of
your OpenSearch service. By
[enabling OpenSearch Security management](/docs/products/opensearch/howto/enable-opensearch-security), you can implement fine-grained access controls, SAML
authentication, and audit logging to track and analyze activities within
your OpenSearch environment.

With OpenSearch Security enabled, you can manage user access and
permissions directly from the
[OpenSearch Dashboard](/docs/products/opensearch/dashboards), giving you full control over your service's security.

    longer use [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), [Aiven
    API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/),
    [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli),
    [Aiven Terraform provider](/docs/tools/terraform) or
    [Aiven Operator for Kubernetes速](/docs/tools/kubernetes) to manage access controls.
-   You must use the OpenSearch Security Dashboard or OpenSearch
    Security API for managing user authentication and access control
    after enabling OpenSearch Security management.
-   Once enabled, OpenSearch Security management cannot be disabled. If
    you need assistance disabling OpenSearch Security management,
    contact [Aiven support](https://aiven.io/support-services).

## OpenSearch Security use cases

OpenSearch Security is a versatile and valuable feature that can meet
the needs of a wide range of customers. Some common use cases for this
feature include:

-   **Single Sign-On integration:**

    If you use an identity management software like Okta or Azure AD,
    you can use SAML integration to access your OpenSearch Dashboard
    through your identity provider. With this feature, you won't need
    to create and manage separate login credentials for OpenSearch,
    simplifying the authentication process.

-   **Advanced access control:**

    If you need different levels of access controls for your employees,
    OpenSearch Security's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can help.
    With RBAC, you can set up different roles with different access
    levels and map them to different users. Role mapping is also
    available with SAML integration, making this feature ideal for
    enterprises.

-   **Compliance and audit logging:**

    If OpenSearch is a critical database in your system, you may need to
    document a historical record of activity for compliance purposes and
    other business policy enforcement. OpenSearch Security includes an
    audit logs feature to help you meet these needs.

-   **Multi-tenancy:**

    If you're a reseller or have many smaller departments, you may need
    different tenants on your OpenSearch Dashboard. OpenSearch Security
    provides multi-tenancy capabilities, ensuring that each tenant's
    data is kept separate and secure.

## OpenSearch Security management changes and impacts

Enabling OpenSearch Security management on your Aiven for OpenSearch
service through the Aiven console triggers several changes:

-   Users and role-based access control will be managed through the
    OpenSearch Security dashboard or OpenSearch Security API.
-   The `os-sec-admin` user will initially be mapped to the pre-defined
    role `service_security_admin_access`, which provides unrestricted
    access to the service, including the OpenSearch Security API and
    OpenSearch Security dashboard.
-   As an `os-sec-admin` user, you can add or remove users from
    pre-defined roles, and create new roles and assignments, but some
    pre-defined roles cannot be changed or deleted.
-   All service users defined before enabling OS Security management are
    included in OpenSearch's internal users, with the attribute
    `provider_managed: False`. However, the users `avnadmin` and
    `os-sec-admin`, are still managed by the service platform and have
    the attribute `provider_managed:true`. While service platform
    management of these users is limited to password changes, they can
    still be assigned to different roles as needed in the OpenSearch
    Security dashboard.

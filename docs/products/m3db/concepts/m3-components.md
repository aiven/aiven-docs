title: Aiven for M3 components
---

M3 consists of three components, which at Aiven are provided as two
separate services:

-   **M3DB** consists of `X` number of M3DB + M3Coordinator pairs. Where
    `X` is the number of nodes in the Aiven plan you choose.
-   **M3 Aggregator** is an optional additional component that you need
    if you use aggregated namespaces, the aggregator does the
    downsampling. Again, the plan you choose dictates how many of these
    you have.

## Example M3 architecture

An example implementation might look something like this with your
application sending data to M3, and the ability to see that data
with GrafanaÂ®.

```mermaid
graph LR
  App(Your application) ---> M3[(M3DB + M3 Coordinator)]
  M3 ----> Gr((Grafana))
  M3 <-.-> Agg(M3 Aggregator)
```

Another common setup is to use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) with
M3 as the storage element.

title: Monitor Aiven services with M3DB
---

M3DB is a perfect fit for a monitoring platform. It is designed to handle large volumes of metrics, and it's very good at that.
Whether
you are already working at scale or just curious about M3DB and
monitoring, setting up an M3DB to monitor your existing Aiven services
(or new ones if you like) is a really nice way to get started with this
platform.

Start from the **Service Overview** page of the service you would like
to monitor with M3. So if you're going to track the metrics of your
PostgreSQL速 service on Aiven, then start on the PostgreSQL速 service
overview page.

1.  Scroll to **Service integrations** and select **Manage
    Integrations**.
2.  Look for **Store Metrics** or **Receive Metrics** (not available on
    all services yet).
3.  Choose either a new or existing M3DB service.
    -   When creating a new service you will need to select the cloud,
        region and plan to use. You should also give your service a
        name. The service overview page shows the nodes rebuilding, and
        then indicates when they are ready.

    -   If you're already using M3DB on Aiven, you can use your M3DB
        service as a destination for your metrics data.

        :::note
        If you are a member of multiple Aiven projects with *operator*
        or *admin* access right, choose the project first
        then your target M3DB services.

To visualize the collected metrics effectively, Grafana速 is a highly
recommended tool. See
[Visualize M3DB data with Grafana速](/docs/products/m3db/howto/grafana).

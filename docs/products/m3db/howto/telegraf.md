title: Write to M3 from Telegraf
---

M3 supports multiple methods of writing metrics to the M3 database.
Two
common options are the InfluxDB® wire-protocol, and the Prometheus
remote write protocol. It is possible to write metrics from an existing
Telegraf setup to M3 using either of these protocols, so we've covered
the configuration for both options.

## Variables

These are the placeholders used in the examples:

| Variable        | Description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `M3_HOST`       | The hostname of your M3DB                |
| `M3_PORT`       | Port where M3DB is running               |
| `AVNADMIN_PASS` | Password for the default `avnadmin` user |

## Configure Telegraf InfluxDB® output plugin for M3

Below is an example of how to configure Telegraf to send metrics to M3
using the InfluxDB line-protocol. These lines belong in the **output
plugins** section of your Telegraf configuration file:

```ini
# Configuration for sending metrics to M3
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  ## The full HTTP URL for your M3 instance.
  urls = ["https://M3_HOST:M3_PORT/api/v1/influxdb"]

  ## If true, no CREATE DATABASE queries will be sent.
  ## Even if sent, does not affect M3 in any way.
  skip_database_creation = true

  ## HTTP Basic Auth
  username = "avnadmin"
  password = "secretpassword"

  ## HTTP Content-Encoding for write request body, can be set to
  ## "gzip" to compress body or "identity" to apply no encoding.

  content_encoding = "gzip"
```

## Configure Telegraf Prometheus remote write for M3

To configure Telegraf to send metrics to M3
using the Prometheus remote write protocol, use the following lines in the output
plugins section of the Telegraf configuration file:

```ini
# Configuration for sending metrics to M3
[outputs.http]
  ## URL is the address to send metrics to
  url = "https://M3_HOST:M3_PORT/api/v1/prom/remote/write"

  ## HTTP Basic Auth credentials
  username = "avnadmin"
  password = "secretpassword"

  ## Data format to output.
  data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

  ## Outgoing HTTP headers
  [outputs.http.headers]
    Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
    Content-Encoding = "snappy"
    X-Prometheus-Remote-Write-Version = "0.1.0"
```

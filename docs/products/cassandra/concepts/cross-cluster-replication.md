title: Cross-cluster replication with Aiven for Apache Cassandra速
limited: true

This article provides an overview of the cross-cluster replication (CCR) feature for Aiven for Apache Cassandra速. Learn what CCR is and how it works. Discover how you can benefit from this feature and what limits and limitations it has.

## About cross-cluster replication

Cross-cluster replication (CCR) is a configuration of Apache Cassandra
services on the Aiven platform that mirrors your data between different
clouds and/or regions, providing increased durability and locality. You
can choose which region to replicate your data to. CCR deploys a single
multi-datacenter Apache Cassandra cluster across two Aiven services.
Apache Cassandra is configured to treat nodes from a single service as
located in a single datacenter.

## Why use CCR

-   **Improved data availability**: CCR improves the disaster recovery
    capability for your service. Even if one service (cloud provider or
    region) goes down, your data stays safe and available with the CCR
    peer, which is another service with a different cloud provider or
    region.
-   **Improved performance**: Enabling CCR on your service, you can set
    up your client to interact with the service that is geographically
    close. The data locality benefit translates into a lower latency and
    improved data processing performance.

## Data flow architecture

When you enable CCR on your Aiven for Apache Cassandra service, you
connect to another service so that the two services (CCR pair) can
replicate data to each other. The CCR service pair constitutes a single
Apache Cassandra cluster that comprises nodes from the two services. The
services are located in different regions and the nodes of a single
service comprise a single datacenter.

## How it works

### Replication strategy

Apache Cassandra allows specifying the replication strategy when
creating a keyspace.

:::note[What is the keyspace?]
It is a namespace defining a replication strategy and particular options
for a group of tables.
:::

With the replication strategy defined in the CREATE KEYSPACE query,
every table in the keyspace is replicated within the cluster according
to the specified strategy.

### `NetworkTopologyStrategy`

The replication strategy that allows CCR in Aiven for Apache Cassandra
is called
[NetworkTopologyStrategy](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/4.1/cassandra/cql/ddl.html#networktopologystrategy).

`NetworkTopologyStrategy` can be set up as the replication strategy when
creating a keyspace on the cluster. The same CREATE KEYSPACE query can
be used to specify the replication factor and a datacenter that data can
be replicated to.

Datacenter per service

:   For the CCR feature to work, the two services that cross-replicate
    need to be located in two different datacenters.

Replication factor

:   The replication factor is defined in the CREATE KEYSPACE query to
    indicate the number of copies of the data to be saved per cluster
    (in each datacenter).

:::note[See also]
For more details on the replication factor for Apache Cassandra, see
[NetworkTopologyStrategy](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/4.1/cassandra/cql/ddl.html#networktopologystrategy)
in the Apache Cassandra documentation.
:::

### CCR setup

To make CCR work on your services, you need a cluster comprising two
Apache Cassandra services with CCR enabled. On the cluster, you need to
issue the CREATE KEYSPACE request, specifying `NetworkTopologyStrategy`
as a replication strategy along with desired replication factors.

```bash
CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication =  /
{                                        /
 'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy',     /
 'service-1': 3,                         /
 'service-2': 3                          /
};
```

Where `service-1` and `service-2` are the names of Apache Cassandra
datacenter, which you can find in the Aiven console.

### CCR in action

With CCR enabled and configured, Apache Cassandra replicates each write
in the keyspace to both services (datacenters) with an appropriate
number of copies as per replication factor.

-   **Active-active model**: Apache Cassandra uses an active-active
    model: clients have the choice of reading/writing either from one
    service or the other.
-   **Consistency level**: The consistency level regulates how many
    nodes need to confirm they executed an operation for this operation
    to be considered successfully completed by the client. You can set
    up the consistency level to one of the allowed consistency level
    arguments depending on your needs.

:::note[Examples]
-   LOCAL_QUORUM consistency level: The read is contained within the
    service you connect to (completes faster).
-   QUORUM consistency level: Replies from nodes of both services are
    required. The read produces more consistent results but fails if one
    of the regions is unavailable.

## Limitations {#ccr-limitations}

-   It is not possible to connect two existing services to become a CCR
    pair. But you still can:

    -   Create a CCR pair from scratch or,
    -   Add a new region to an existing service (create a new service
        that replicates from your existing service).

-   Enabling CCR on an existing service is only possible if this service
    has a keyspace that uses `NetworkTopologyStrategy` as a replication
    strategy.

-   Two CCR services need to use an identical service plan and the same
    amount of dynamic disk space.

-   Limited replication configuration

    -   `SimpleReplicationStrategy` not supported
    -   Unbalanced `NetworkTopologyStrategy` not supported (both CCR
        peer services need the same replication factor)

-   Value of the replication factor needs to be equal to or greater than
    `2`.

    :::warning
    If you set the replication factor value below `2`, you may have it
    changed automatically at any time.
    :::

-   Once a CCR service pair is split, the clusters cannot be
    reconnected.

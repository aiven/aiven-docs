title: Connect with Go

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource1 from '!!raw-loader!/code/products/cassandra/connect.go';

This example connects to an Aiven for Apache CassandraÂ® service from Go
as the `avnadmin` user by making use of the `gocql` library.

## Variables

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

| Variable       | Description                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HOST`         | Host name of your Cassandra service                                            |
| `PORT`         | Port number used for connecting to your Cassandra service                      |
| `USER`         | Username used for connecting to your Cassandra service. Defaults to `avnadmin` |
| `PASSWORD`     | Password of the `avnadmin` user                                                |
| `SSL-CERTFILE` | Path to the `CA Certificate` file of your Cassandra service                    |


## Prerequisites

Get the `gocql` library:

```
go get github.com/gocql/gocql
```

## Code

1.  Create a file named `main.go` and add the following content:

    <CodeBlock language='go'>{MyComponentSource1}</CodeBlock>

    This code first creates a keyspace named `example_keyspace` and a
    table named `example_go` that contains an `id` and a `message`.
    Then, it writes a new entry into the table with the values `1. and
    `hello world`. Finally, it reads the entry from the table and prints
    it.

1.  Execute the following from a terminal window to build an executable:

    ```
    go build main.go
    ```

1.  Run the program with the required flags to pass the necessary
    connection details:

    ```
    ./main --host <HOST> --port <PORT> --user avnadmin --password <PASSWORD> --ssl-certfile <PATH TO CERTFILE>
    ```

title: Connect with cqlsh
---

This example shows how to connect to an Aiven for Apache CassandraÂ®
service using `cqlsh`.

## Prerequisites

For this example you need to have:

1.  The `clqsh` client installed. You can install this as part of the
    [Cassandra server
    installation](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/getting_started/installing.html).
2.  Your service's **CA Certificate** downloaded and saved in your file
    system.

## Variables

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

| Variable       | Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PASSWORD`     | Password of the `avnadmin` user                        |
| `HOST`         | Host name for the connection                           |
| `PORT`         | Port number to use for the Cassandra service           |
| `SSL_CERTFILE` | Path of the `CA Certificate` for the Cassandra service |

:::tip
All the above variables and the CA Certificate file can be found in
[Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), in the service detail page.
:::

## Code

Set the `SSL_CERTFILE` environment variable to the location of the *CA
Certificate* for the Cassandra service:

```
export SSL_CERTFILE=<PATH>
```

:::note
Alternatively, you can provide the path to the CA Certificate file in
the `[ssl]` section by setting the the `certfile` parameter in
`~/.cassandra/cqlshrc`
:::

Navigate to the directory of your local Cassandra installation and
execute the following from a terminal window:

```
./cqlsh --ssl -u avnadmin -p <PASSWORD> <HOST> <PORT>
```

You are now connected to the Cassandra database.

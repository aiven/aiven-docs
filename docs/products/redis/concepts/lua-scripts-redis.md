title: Lua scripts with Aiven for Redis®*
---

Learn how to leverage the inbuilt support for Lua scripting in Redis®\*
using Aiven.

Redis®\* has inbuilt support for running Lua scripts to perform various
actions directly on the Redis server. Scripting is typically controlled
using the `EVAL`, `EVALSHA` and `SCRIPT LOAD` commands.

For all newly-created Redis instances, `EVAL`, `EVALSHA` and
`SCRIPT LOAD` commands are enabled by default.

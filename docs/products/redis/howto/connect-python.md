title: Connect with Python

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource1 from '!!raw-loader!/code/products/redis/connect.py';

This example connects to RedisÂ®\* service from Python, making use of the
`redis-py` library.

## Variables

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

| Variable    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `REDIS_URI` | URL for the Redis connection, from the service overview page |

## Prerequisites

Install the `redis-py` library:

```
pip install redis
```

## Code

Create a new file named `main.py`, add the following content and replace
the placeholder with the Redis URI:

<CodeBlock language='python'>{MyComponentSource1}</CodeBlock>

This code creates a key named `key` with the value `hello world` and no
expiration time. Then, it gets the key back from Redis and prints its
value.

Run the code:

```
python main.py
```

:::note
Note that on some systems you will need to use `python3` to get Python3
rather than the previous Python2
:::

If the script runs successfully, the outputs should be:

```
The value of key is: hello world
```

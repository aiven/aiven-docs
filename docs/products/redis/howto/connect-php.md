title: Connect with PHP
---

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource1 from '!!raw-loader!/code/products/redis/connect.php';

This example connects to RedisÂ®\* service from PHP, making use of the
`predis` library.

## Variables

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

 | Variable    | Description                                                  |
 | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
 | `REDIS_URI` | URL for the Redis connection, from the service overview page |

## Prerequisites

Install the `predis` library:

```
composer require predis/predis
```

## Code

Create a new file named `index.php`, add the following content and
replace the placeholder with the Redis URI:

<CodeBlock language='php'>{MyComponentSource1}</CodeBlock>

This code creates a key named `key` with the value `hello world` and no
expiration time. Then, it gets the key back from Redis and prints its
value.

Run the code:

```
php index.php
```

If the script runs successfully, the outputs should be:

```
The value of key is: hello world
```

title: Connect with redis-cli
---

This example connects to a Redis®\* service from `redis-cli`.

## Variables

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

| Variable    | Description                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REDIS_URI` | URL for Redis connection, from the service overview page |

## Prerequisites

For this example you will need:

1.  The `redis-cli` client installed. You can install this as part of
    the [Redis server
    installation](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/tutorial/) or as
    standalone client.

## Code

Execute the following from a terminal window:

```
redis-cli -u REDIS_URI
```

This code connects to the Redis®\* database.

To check the connection is working, execute the following code:

```
INFO
```

The command returns all the Redis parameters:

```text
# Server
redis_version:6.2.3
redis_git_sha1:c708fc4f
redis_git_dirty:1
redis_build_id:eca3e7fbe7ce45c7
redis_mode:standalone
...
```

To set a key, execute the following command:

```
SET mykey mykeyvalue123
```

The command should output a confirmation `OK` statement.

To retrieve the key value, execute the following command:

```
GET mykey
```

The result is the value of the key, in the above example
`"mykeyvalue123"`.

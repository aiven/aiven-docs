title: Migrate from Redis®* to Aiven for Redis®* using the CLI
---

Move your data from a source, standalone Redis®\* data store to an
Aiven-managed Redis service. The migration first attempts to use the
`replication` method, and if it fails, it uses `scan`.

In the following steps, we show you how to create a new Aiven for Redis
service, and migrate data from AWS ElastiCache Redis. The Aiven project
name is `test`, and the service name for the target Aiven for Redis is
`redis`.

:::important
Migrating from Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis is not currently
supported.

The version of the source Redis service cannot be higher than the version
of the target Aiven for Redis®* service.
:::

## What you'll need

-   A target Aiven for Redis service. See
    [Get started with Aiven for Redis®*](/docs/products/redis/get-started) to
    create one, or follow the instructions below.
-   The hostname, port and password of the source Redis service.
-   The source Redis service secured with SSL which is the default for
    migration.
-   Publicly accessible source Redis service or a service with a VPC
    peering between the private networks. The migration process requires
    VPC ID and the cloud name.

:::note
AWS ElastiCache for Redis instances cannot have public IP addresses, and
thus require project VPC and peering connection.

## Create a service and perform the migration

1.  Check the Aiven configuration options and Redis connection details:

    -   For Aiven configuration options, type:

        ```
        avn service types -v

        ...
        Service type 'redis' options:
        ...
        Remove migration
            => --remove-option migration
        Hostname or IP address of the server where to migrate data from
            => -c migration.host=<string>
        Password for authentication with the server where to migrate data from
            => -c migration.password=<string>
        Port number of the server where to migrate data from
            => -c migration.port=<integer>
        The server where to migrate data from is secured with SSL
            => -c migration.ssl=<boolean>  (default=True)
        User name for authentication with the server where to migrate data from
            => -c migration.username=<string>
        ```

    -   for the VPC information, type:

        ```
        avn vpc list --project test

        PROJECT_VPC_ID                        CLOUD_NAME     ...
        ====================================  =============
        40ddf681-0e89-4bce-bd89-25e246047731  aws-eu-west-1
        ```

        :::note
        Here are your required values for the hostname, port and
        password of the source Redis service, as well as the VPD ID and
        cloud name.
        :::

2.  Create the Aiven for Redis service (if you don't have one yet), and
    migrate:

    ```
    avn service create --project test -t redis -p hobbyist --cloud aws-eu-west-1 --project-vpc-id 40ddf681-0e89-4bce-bd89-25e246047731 -c migration.host="master.jappja-redis.kdrxxz.euw1.cache.amazonaws.com" -c migration.port=6379 -c migration.password=<password> redis
    ```

    :::tip
    If the source Redis server is publicly accessible, the
    project-vpc-id and cloud parameters are not needed.
    :::

3.  Check the migration status:

    ```
    avn service migration-status --project test redis

    STATUS  METHOD  ERROR
    ======  ======  =====
    done    scan    null
    ```

    :::note
    Status can be one of `done`, `failed` or `running`. In case of
    failure, the error contains the error message:

    ```
    avn service migration-status --project test redis

    STATUS  METHOD  ERROR
    ======  ======  ================
    failed  scan    invalid password
    ```
    :::

## Migrate to an existing Aiven for Redis service

Migrate to an existing Aiven for Redis service by updating the service
configuration:

```
avn service update --project test -c migration.host="master.jappja-redis.kdrxxz.euw1.cache.amazonaws.com" -c migration.port=6379 -c migration.password=<password> redis
```

## Remove migration from configuration

Migration is one-time operation - once the status is `done`, the
migration cannot be restarted. If you need to run migration again, you
should first remove it from the configuration, and then configure it
again:

```
avn service update --project test --remove-option migration redis
```

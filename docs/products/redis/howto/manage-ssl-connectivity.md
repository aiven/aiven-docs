## Client support for SSL-encrypted connections

### Default support

Aiven for RedisÂ®\* uses SSL encrypted connections by default. This is
shown by the use of `rediss://` (with double `s`) prefix in the
`Service URI` on the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

:::tip
You can find the `Service URI` on [Aiven
console](https://console.aiven.io/).
:::

Since **Redis 6**, the `redis-cli` tool itself supports SSL connections;
therefore, you can connect directly to your service using:

```
redis-cli -u rediss://username:password@host:port
```

Alternatively, you can use the third-party [Redli
tool](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/redli):

```
redli -u rediss://username:password@host:port
```

Not every Redis client supports SSL-encrypted connections. In such
cases, you would have to turn off or bypass the SSL to use these
clients, which is allowed but **not recommended**. You can use one of
the following option to achieve this.

### Set up `stunnel` process

If you want to keep SSL settings on database side, but hide it from the
client side, you can set up a `stunnel` process on the client to handle
encryption.

You can use the following `stunnel` configuration, for example
`stunnel.conf`, to set up a `stunnel` process.

```
client = yes
foreground = yes
debug = info
delay = yes

[redis]
accept = 127.0.0.1:6380
connect = myredis.testproject.aivencloud.com:28173
TIMEOUTclose = 0
; For old services only. New ones use Let's Encrypt and there's no
; CA cert available from Aiven console. Most environments trust
; Let's Encrypt by default without any explicit CAfile config.
; CAfile = /path/to/optional/project/cacert/that/you/can/download/from/aiven/console
```

To understand the global options of the `stunnel` configuration, please
check [Stunnel Global
Options](https://www.stunnel.org/static/stunnel.html#GLOBAL-OPTIONS).
Also, you can find out more details about how to setup such a process on
the [Stunnel website page](https://www.stunnel.org/index.html).

For `service-level option`, the following parameters are configured:

-   `accept => *[host:]port*`: Accept connections on the specified
    address.
-   `connect => *[host:]port*`: Connect to a remote address.
-   `TIMEOUTclose => *seconds*`: Time to wait for close_notify.

:::note
It is important to make changes accordingly to your service. On the
**Overview** page you can find your **Overview** > **Host** and
**Overview** > **Port** to configure the `connect` parameter.
:::

When SSL is in use, HAProxy is responsible for terminating the SSL
connections before they get forwarded to Redis. This process has a
connection timeout set to 12 hours which is not configurable by the
customer. If you allow very long Redis timeouts, this SSL-terminating
HAProxy may end up closing the connection before the Redis timeout has
expired. This timeout is independent of Redis timeout.

### Allow plain-text connections

An alternative is disable database SSL allowing allow plain-text
connections. To allow plain-text connections, you can change this
setting on **Overview** in the **Advanced configuration** section, or
using the
[Aiven Command Line interface](/docs/tools/cli).

:::warning
Allowing plain-text connections can have some implications regarding the
security of your Redis service. If SSL is turned off, anyone who can
eavesdrop on the traffic can potentially have access to your
credentials; therefore, your Aiven for Redis service.
:::

To disable SSL on an existing Redis instance use the following Aiven CLI
command substituting the `<my-redis>` with your Redis the name service
chosen by you when the service was created.

```console
avn service update <my-redis> -c "redis_ssl=false"
```

After executing the command, the `Service URI` points to the new
location and starts with the `redis://` (removing the extra `s`) prefix
meaning it's a direct Redis connection which does not use SSL.

title: PostgreSQL® metrics exposed in Grafana®
---

The metrics/dashboard integration in the Aiven console enables you to
push PostgreSQL® metrics to an external endpoint like Datadog or to
create an integration and a prebuilt dashboard in Aiven for Grafana®.
For more information on enabling the integration, see
[Monitor PostgreSQL® metrics with Grafana®](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/report-metrics-grafana). This article describes the default dashboard created in
Grafana for any PostgreSQL instance.

## General info about default dashboards

A few key points about the default dashboards pre-created by Aiven in
Grafana:

1.  The PostgreSQL dashboards show all tables and indexes for all
    logical databases since Aiven cannot determine tables or indexes
    relevance.
2.  Some metrics are gathered but not shown in the default dashboard,
    you can access all available metrics by creating new dashboards.
3.  New dashboards can be created to show any metrics or use any
    filtering criteria. The default dashboard can be used as a template
    to make the process easier.

:::warning
When creating new dashboards, do not prefix the names with **"Aiven"**
because they may be removed or replaced. The \"Aiven\" prefix is used to
identify Aiven's system-managed dashboards. This also applies to the
default dashboard, for which any direct editing to it could be lost.

## PostgreSQL metrics prebuilt dashboard

The PostgreSQL default dashboard is split into several sections under
two main categories: Generic and PostgreSQL. **Generic** metrics are not
specific to the type of service running on the node and mostly related
to CPU, memory, disk, and network. **PostgreSQL** metrics are specific
for the service.

## General metrics

### Overview

This section shows a high-level overview of the service node health.
Major issues with the service are often visible directly in this
section.

:::note
In the Overview section, the figures for Business and Premium services
are averages of all nodes that belong to the service. For some metrics,
such as disk space, this typically does not matter since it's equal
across all the nodes. For other metrics, especially when related to load
concentrated only on the primary node, high values can be dampened by
the average. Node-specific values are shown in the **system metrics**
section.

The following metrics are shown:

| Parameter Name     | Parameter Definition                            | Additional Notes                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Uptime`           | The time the service has been up and running.   |
| `Load average`     | The number of processes that would want to run. | If the `Load average` figure is higher than the number of CPUs on the nodes, the service can be **under-provisioned**. |
| `Memory available` | Memory not allocated by running processes.      |
| `Disk free`        | Amount of unused disk space.                    |

### System metrics

This section shows a more detailed listing of various generic
system-related metrics.

![Grafana Dashboard for PostgreSQL System Metrics Section](/images/content/products/postgresql/metrics-dashboard-system.png)

The following metrics are shown:

| Parameter Name                        | Parameter Definition                                                                                    | Additional Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `CPU`                                 | `System`, `user`, `iowait`, and `interrupt` request (IRQ) CPU usage.                                    | A high `iowait` is an indication that the system is writing or reading too much data to or from disk.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Load average`                        | The number of processes that would want to run.                                                         | The `Load average` figure is higher than the number of CPUs on the nodes, the service might be **under-provisioned**.                                                                                                                                  |
| `Memory available`                    | The amount of memory not allocated by running processes.                                                |
| `Memory unused`                       | The amount of memory not allocated by running processes or used for buffer caches.                      |
| `Context switches`                    | The number of switches from one process or thread to another.                                           |
| `Interrupts`                          | The number of interrupts per second.                                                                    |
| `Processes`                           | The number of processes that are actively doing something.                                              | Processes that are mostly idle are not included.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Disk free`                           | The current amount of remaining disk space.                                                             | Aiven suggest to actively monitor this value and associate it with an alert. The database will stop working correctly if it runs out of disk space.                                                                                                    |
| `Disk i/o`                            | The number of bytes read and written per second on each of the nodes.                                   |
| `Data disk usage`                     | The amount of disk space that is in use on the service's data disk.                                     |
| `CPU iowait`                          | The percentage of CPU time spent waiting for the disk to become available for read and write operations | Aiven suggest to create an alert that is triggered when `iowait` goes beyond a certain threshold for an extended time. This gives you an opportunity to respond quickly when the database starts to slow down from too many read and write operations. |
| `Network`                             | The number of inbound and outbound bytes per second for a node.                                         |
| `Network (sum of all nodes)`          | The same as the `Network` graph, but values are not grouped by service node.                            |
| `TCP connections`                     | The number of open TCP connections, grouped by node.                                                    |
| `TCP socket state total on all nodes` | The number of TCP connections across all service nodes, grouped by the TCP connection state.            |

## PostgreSQL-specific metrics

For most metrics, the metric name identifies the internal PostgreSQL
statistics view. See the [PostgreSQL
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html)
for more detailed explanations of the various metric values.

Metrics that are currently recorded but not shown in the default
dashboard include `postgresql.pg_stat_bgwriter` and
`postgresql.pg_class` metrics as a whole, as well as some individual
values from other metrics.

### PostgreSQL overview

The metrics in the PostgreSQL overview section are grouped by logical
database. In addition, some metrics are grouped by host.

| `Database size`                       | The size of the files associated with a logical database                                                                  | Some potentially large files that are not included in this value. Most notably, the write-ahead log (WAL) is not included in the size of the logical databases as it is not tied to any specific logical database.                                                                                                                                    |
| `Connections`                         | The number of open connections to the database                                                                            | Each connection puts a large burden on the PostgreSQL server and this number should typically be [fairly small even for large plans](/docs/products/postgresql/reference/pg-connection-limits). Use connection pooling to [reduce the number of connections](/docs/products/postgresql/concepts/pg-connection-pooling) to the actual database server. |
| `Oldest running query age`            | The age of the oldest running query                                                                                       | Typical queries run in milliseconds, and having queries that run for minutes often indicates an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Oldest connection age`               | The age of the oldest connection.                                                                                         | Old open connections with open transactions are a problem, because they prevent `VACUUM` from performing correctly, resulting in bloat and performance degradation.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `Disk block reads / sec`              | The number of 8 kB disk blocks that PostgreSQL reads per second, excluding reads that were satisfied by the buffer cache. | The read operations may have been satisfied by the operating system's file system cache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Buffer cache disk block reads / sec` | The number of 8 kB disk blocks that PostgreSQL reads per second that were already in buffer cache.                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Temp files created / min`            | The number of temporary files that PostgreSQL created per minute.                                                         | Temporary files are usually created when a query requests a large result set that can't fit in memory and needs to be sorted or when a query joins large result sets. A high number of temporary files or temporary file bytes may indicate that you should increase the working memory setting.                                                      |
| `Temp file bytes written / sec`       | The number of bytes written to temporary files per second                                                                 | This value should be kept at reasonable levels to avoid the server becoming IO-bound from having to write so much data to temporary files.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Deadlocks / min`                     | The number of deadlocks per minute.                                                                                       | Deadlocks occur when different transactions obtain row-level locks for two or more of the same rows in a different order. You can resolve deadlock situations by retrying the transactions on the client side, but deadlocks can create significant bottlenecks and high counts are something that you should investigate.                            |

### PostgreSQL indexes

This section contains graphs related to the size and use of **indexes**.
Since the default dashboard contains all indexes in all logical
databases, it is easily convoluted for complex databases.

:::tip
You might want to make a copy of the default dashboard and add
additional constraints for the graphs to filter out uninteresting
indexes. For example, for the size graph, you might want to include only
indexes that are above `X` megabytes in size.

| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `Index size`                | The size of indexes on disk                                |                  |
| `Index scans / sec`         | The number of scans per second per index                   |                  |
| `Index tuple reads / sec`   | The number or tuples read from an index during index scans |                  |
| `Index tuple fetches / sec` | The number of table rows fetched during index scans        |                  |

## Tables

This section contains graphs related to the size and use of **tables**.
As with indexes, the graph will be convoluted for complex databases, and
you may want to make a copy of the dashboard to add additional filters

| `Table dead tuples`                 | The number of rows that have become un-referenced due to an update or deletion for the same row, and uncommitted transactions older than the update or delete operation are no longer running. The rows will be marked reusable during the next `VACUUM`. | High values here may indicate that vacuuming is not aggressive enough. Consider adjusting its configuration to make it run more often, because frequent vacuums reduce table bloat and make the system work better. The `n_live_tup` value is available and can be used to create graphs that show tables with high ratios of dead and live tuples. |
| `Table modifications since analyze` | The number of inserts, updates, or deletions since the last `ANALYZE` operation                                                                                                                                                                           | A high number for this parameter means that the query planner may end up creating bad query plans because it is operating on obsolete data. Vacuuming also performs `ANALYZE`, and you may want to adjust your vacuum settings if you see slow queries and high table modification counts for the related tables.                                   |

### PostgreSQL vacuum and analyse

This section contains graphs related to **vacuum** and **analyze**
operations. The graphs are grouped by table and, for complex databases,
you probably want to add additional filter criteria to only show results
where values are outside the expected range.

| `Xact replay lag`        | The replication lag between primary and standby nodes                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Replication bytes diff` | The replication lag in bytes. This is the total diff across all replication clients. | To differentiate between different standby nodes, you can additionally group by the `client_addr` tag. This graph shows a difference based on `write_lsn`; `flush_lsn` is also available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Unfrozen transactions`  | The number of transactions that have not been frozen as well as the freeze limit     | In very busy systems, the number of transactions that have not been frozen by vacuum operations may rise rapidly and you should monitor this value to ensure the freeze limit is not reached. Reaching the limit causes the system to stop working. If the `txns` values get close to the freeze limit, vacuum settings need to be made more aggressive, and you must resolve any problems that prevent vacuum operations from completing, such as long-running open transactions. |

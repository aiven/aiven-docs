-   **Primary node**: The PostgreSQL® primary node is the main server
    node that processes SQL queries, makes the necessary changes to the
    database files on the disk, and returns the results to the client
    application.
-   **Standby node**: PostgreSQL standby nodes (also called replicas)
    replicate the changes from the primary node and try to maintain an
    up-to-date copy of the same database files that exists on the
    primary node.
-   **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**: The WAL is a log file storing all the
    database transactions in a sequential manner.
-   **pglookout**: [pglookout](https://github.com/aiven/pglookout) is a
    PostgreSQL replication monitoring and failover daemon.
-   **PGHoard**: [PGHoard](https://github.com/aiven/pghoard) is a
    PostgreSQL backup daemon and restore tooling that stores backup data
    in cloud object stores

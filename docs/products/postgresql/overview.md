## About PostgreSQL®

PostgreSQL® is an open source relational database. It's ideal for
organisations that need a well-organised tabular datastore. On top of
the strict table and columns formats, PostgreSQL also offers solutions
for nested datasets with the native `jsonb` format and advanced set of
extensions including [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), a spatial database
extender for location queries. Aiven for PostgreSQL is the perfect fit
for your relational data. A scalable SQL database solution that can be
up and running within a few minutes.

## PostgreSQL resources

If you are new to PostgreSQL, there are lots of great resources out
there to get you started with the platform. Here's our recommended
reading list:

-   [PostgreSQL Project website](https://www.postgresql.org/) providing
    a comprehensive per-release documentation
-   [PostGIS website](https://postgis.net/) to read about location
    queries and the spatial extension

How to solve the out of shared memory error caused by stuck sessions

## Symptoms

If your PostgreSQL service becomes unavailable and you see repeated FATAL: out of shared memory messages in the logs, it may indicate a blocking session, particularly one in an idle in transaction state. This article walks you through identifying and resolving this issue.
You might notice the following types of messages in your PostgreSQL logs:

FATAL:  out of shared memory

Example:
```shell
2024-09-11T18:31:19.653257+0000 postgresql-13: pid=1031851,user=_db,db=_db FATAL:  out of shared memory
pgbouncer_internal: login failed: FATAL: out of shared memory
```
This may even prevent superuser connections.

## Root Cause

A common reason for this issue is a session stuck in the idle in transaction state. Such a session may hold on to locks and memory resources indefinitely, eventually leading to memory exhaustion.

## How to Identify the Problem

Confirm Using Grafana (If Available)

Inspect the metric for Oldest query age / Longest running query. A value like 16.7 hours indicates an open transaction thatâ€™s been running too long and likely causing memory exhaustion.

## Why Does This Happen?

There are two typical causes:

### Application-level Exception Handling:
- The application opens a transaction with BEGIN
- Executes a query
- Throws an unhandled exception while processing the result
- The application thread hangs, but keeps the connection open

PostgreSQL backend waits indefinitely, holding the transaction open

### Missing Cleanup Logic:

Applications may not implement proper transaction timeouts or cleanup routines

## Best Practices to Prevent This

Set idle_in_transaction_session_timeout in PostgreSQL to automatically terminate sessions stuck in this state. Default is 24 hours. You may reduce it to something like 5 minutes in your user config.

Implement connection timeouts and error handling in your application logic, monitor long-running queries and transactions using PostgreSQL metrics

Discover the PgBouncer connection pooler and check out how to cope with
some specific connection pooling issues.

## About connection pooling with PgBouncer

PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQLÂ® with low
memory requirements (2 kB per connection by default).

PgBouncer offers several methods when rotating connections:

-   **Session pooling:** This is the most permissive method. When a
    client connects, it gets assigned with a server connection that is
    maintained as long as the client stays connected. When the client
    disconnects, the server connection is put back into the pool. This
    mode supports all PostgreSQL features.

-   **Transaction pooling:** A server connection is assigned to a client
    only during a transaction. When PgBouncer notices that the
    transaction is over, the server connection is put back into the
    pool.

    :::warning
    This mode breaks a few session-based features of PostgreSQL. Use it
    only when the application cooperates without using the features that
    break. For incompatible features, see [PostgreSQL feature map for
    pooling modes](https://www.pgbouncer.org/features).
    :::

-   **Statement pooling:** This is the most restrictive method, which
    disallows multi-statement transactions. This is meant to enforce the
    `autocommit` mode on the client and is mostly targeted at PL/Proxy.

## Handling connection pooling issues

A high CPU utilization while using the PgBouncer pooling may indicate a
usage anti-pattern with a suboptimal pooling method selection or
frequent reconnect operations.

SSL handshakes are expensive resource-wise with asymmetric cryptography
adding overhead. After a negotiation, relatively efficient symmetric
ciphers are used.

If clients in the application pool frequently disconnect between
queries, this negates part of the benefit of the pooler and adds
additional overhead.

For most applications with a large pool of clients, the transaction
pooling allows the application pool to maintain their connections, thus
avoiding the overhead of new connection requests.

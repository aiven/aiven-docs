title: Connect with Python

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource1 from '!!raw-loader!/code/products/postgresql/connect.py';

This example connects to a PostgreSQLÂ® service from Python, making use
of the `psycopg2` library.

## Variables

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

| Variable         | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRESQL_URI` | URL for PostgreSQL connection, from the service overview page |

## Prerequisites

For this example you will need:

-   Python 3.6 or later

-   The Python `psycopg2` library. You can install this with `pip`:

    ```
    pip install psycopg2
    ```

## Code

Add the following to `main.py` and replace the placeholders with values
for your project:

<CodeBlock language='python'>{MyComponentSource1}</CodeBlock>

This code creates a PostgreSQL client and connects to the database. Then
runs a query checking the database version and prints the response

:::note
By default, the connection string specifies `sslmode=require` which does
not verify the CA certificate. A better approach for production would be
to change it to `sslmode=verify-ca` and include the certificate.
:::

To run the code:

```
python main.py
```

If the script runs successfully, the outputs should be the PostgreSQL
version running in your service like:

```
PostgreSQL 13.3 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc, a 68c5366192 p 6520304dc1, 64-bit
```

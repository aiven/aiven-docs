title: Visualize PostgreSQL速 data with Grafana速
---

PostgreSQL速 can hold a wide variety of types of data, and creating
visualisations helps gather insights on top of raw figures. Luckily,
Aiven can set up the Grafana速 and the integration between the two
services for you.

## Integrate PostgreSQL and Grafana

1.  On the **Overview** page for your Aiven for PostgreSQL service, go
    to **Manage integrations** and choose the **Monitor Data in
    Grafana** option.
2.  Choose either a new or existing Grafana service.
    -   A new service will ask you to select the cloud, region and plan
        to use. You should also give your service a name. The service
        overview page shows the nodes rebuilding, and then indicates
        when they are ready.
    -   If you're already using Grafana on Aiven, you can integrate
        your PostgreSQL as a data source for that existing Grafana.
3.  On the **Overview** page for your Aiven for Grafana service, select
    the **Service URI** link. The username and password for your Grafana
    service is also available on the service's **Overview** page.

Now your Grafana service is connected to PostgreSQL as a data source and
you can go ahead and visualise your data.

## Visualize PostgreSQL data in Grafana

In Grafana, create a new dashboard and add a panel to it.

The datasource dropdown shows `--Grafana--` by default, but you will
also find your PostgreSQL service listed here.

With your PostgreSQL service selected, the \"Query\" section will show
the metrics from the database in its dropdown.

:::tip
If no metrics are shown, check that there is data in the database
:::

Once you are happy with your panel, give it a title and click \"Save\"
in the top right hand corner.

:::tip
Grafana expects a Time column in the query, if you don't have any, use
the function `NOW()` which generates the up-to-date timestamp.

Fundamentals](https://grafana.com/tutorials/grafana-fundamentals/?pg=docs)
page on the Grafana project site.

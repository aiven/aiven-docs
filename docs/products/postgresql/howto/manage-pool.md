[Connection pooling](/docs/products/postgresql/concepts/pg-connection-pooling) lets you maintain very large numbers of connections to a database while minimizing the consumption of server resources.

## Connection pooling tips

You can connect directly to the PostgreSQLÂ® server using the **Service
URI** setting listed on the **Overview** page. However, this URI
doesn't make use of the PgBouncer pooling. PgBouncer pools use a
different port number than the regular PostgreSQL server port. The
PgBouncer **Service URI** for a particular pool is in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) > your service's page > <ConsoleLabel name="pools"/>.
You can also view the generic PgBouncer service URI for your pools on your service's
**Overview** page > **Connection information** > **PgBouncer** tab.

You can use both pooled and non-pooled connections at the same time.

:::note
If you have set a custom `search_path` for your database, this is not
automatically set for your new connection pool. Remember to set it also
for new connection pools when you create them.

## Manage connection pools

To manage the connection pools:

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) and select your
    Aiven for PostgreSQL service.

1.  Click <ConsoleLabel name="pools"/> from the sidebar.

1.  In the **Connection pools** view, you can check the available connection pools
    and add or remove them.

    The settings available are as follows:

    -   **Pool name**: Enter a name for your connection pool. This
        also becomes the `database` or `dbname` connection parameter for
        your pooled client connections. This parameter must be equal to
        the `Database` parameter.
    -   **Database**: Choose the database to connect to.
        Each pool can only connect to a single database.
    -   **Username**: Select the database username to use
        when connecting to the backend database.
    -   **Pool Mode**: Select the
        [pooling mode](/docs/products/postgresql/concepts/pg-connection-pooling#pooling-modes).
    -   **Pool Size**: Select how many PostgreSQL server connections
        this pool can use at a time.

    :::important
    The **Pool Size** parameter is NOT the maximum number of client
    connections of this pool.

    Each pool can handle from a minimum of 5000 client connections to a
    maximum defined by the lower threshold between:

    -   500 for each GB of RAM in the service plan
    -   A total of 50000 client connections

## Connection pools for replicas

For all Business and Premium plans, whenever you define a connection
pool, the same connection pool is created both for primary and standby
servers. For standby servers, the connection pool URI is exactly the
same as for the primary server, except that the host name has a
`replica-` prefix.

For example, if the primary connection URI is as follows:

```
postgres://avnadmin:password@pg-prod-myproject.aivencloud.com:20986/mypool?params
```

The replica connection pool URI is as follows:

```
postgres://avnadmin:password@replica-pg-prod-myproject.aivencloud.com:20986/mypool?params
```

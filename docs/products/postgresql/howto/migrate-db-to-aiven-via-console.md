title: Migrate PostgreSQL® databases to Aiven using the console
---

You can migrate PostgreSQL® databases to Aiven using either
[CLI](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/migrate-aiven-db-migrate) (`aiven-db-migrate`) or [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/). This article addresses the latter
scenario by providing guidelines on how to use [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) to migrate PostgreSQL databases to
the Aiven platform.

:::note
For the other migration method (using `aiven-db-migrate`), see
[Migrate to Aiven for PostgreSQL® with aiven-db-migrate](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/migrate-aiven-db-migrate).

## About migrating via console

The console migration tool enables you to migrate PostgreSQL databases
to managed PostgreSQL clusters in your Aiven organization. You can
migrate the following:

-   Existing on-premise PostgreSQL databases
-   Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL databases
-   Managed PostgreSQL database clusters on Aiven.

With the console migration tool, you can migrate your data using either
the
[continuous migration method](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/migrate-db-to-aiven-via-console#pg-continuous-migration) (default and recommended) or the
[one-time snapshot method](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/migrate-db-to-aiven-via-console#pg-dump-migration) (`pg_dump`).

### Continuous migration {#pg-continuous-migration}

The continuous migration method is used by default in the console and
taken as a method to follow in this guide. The continuous migration
keeps the source database operational during the migration. This method
uses [logical
replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html),
which enables data transfer not only for the data that has already been
there in the source database when triggering the migration but also for
any data written to the source database during the migration.

:::important
Before you use the logical replication, make sure you know and
understand all the restrictions it has. For details, check out [Logical
replication
restrictions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-restrictions.html).
:::

Using the continuous migration requires either superuser permissions or
the `aiven_extras` extension installed on the source database.

<details><summary>
Expand to check out how to verify that you have superuser permissions.
</summary>

Use `psql` to run the `\du` command:

``` bash
\du
```

```bash title="Expected output"
Role name |                      Attributes                            |                 Member of
----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
_source_db     | Superuser, Replication                                | {}
example   | Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS            | {pg_read_all_stats,pg_stat_scan_tables,pg_signal_backend}
postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}
```

Identify your role name in the `Role name` column and check if it has
the `Superuser` attribute assigned in the `Attributes` column. If not,
request it from your system administrator.

</details>

:::note[No superuser permissions? Install `aiven_extras`.]
If you don\'t have superuser permissions, but you still want to use the
continuous migration, you can install the `aiven_extras` extension on
the source database using the following command:

``` bash
CREATE EXTENSION `aiven_extras` CASCADE;
```
:::

### Dump migration {#pg-dump-migration}

`pg_dump` is a point-in-time snapshot. The data written to the source
database during the migration process (after initiating the dump) is not
migrated to the target database. When you start a dump migration, make
sure no data is written to the source database by the time the dumping
process is over.

When you trigger the migration setup in the console and initial checks
detect that your source database does not support the logical
replication, you are notified about it via wizard. To continue with the
migration, you can select the alternative `pg_dump` migration method in
the wizard.

:::note[No superuser permissions and no `aiven_extras`? Migrate using the dump method.]
Without superuser permissions or `aiven_extras` installed, you cannot
use the logical replication and migrate in a continuous manner. In that
case, you can migrate your database using the dump method if you have
the following permissions:

-   Connect
-   Select on all tables in the database
-   Select on all the sequences in the database
:::

For the instruction on how to perform a dump, skip a few sections that
follow and go straight to
[Migrate a database](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/migrate-db-to-aiven-via-console#migrate-in-console).

## Prerequisites

-   To use the default continuous migration method in the console, you
    need to have the logical replication enabled on your source database
    either with superuser permissions or the `aiven_extras` extension.
-   Source database's hostname or IP address needs to be
    [accessible from the public Internet](/docs/platform/howto/public-access-in-vpc).
-   You need to have the following source database's credentials and
    reference data:
    -   Public hostname or connection string, or IP address used to
        connect to the database
    -   Port used to connect to the database
    -   Username (for a user with superuser permissions)
    -   Password.
-   Firewalls protecting the source database and the target databases
    need to be open to allow the traffic and connection between the
    databases (update or disable the firewalls temporarily if needed).

## Pre-configure the source

-   Allow remote connections on the source database.

    Check that your database allows all remote connections by using
    `psql` to run the following query:

    ``` bash
    SHOW listen_addresses;
    ```

    If enabled, you can expect the following output (with
    `listen_addresses` set to `*`):

    ``` bash
    listen_addresses
    -----------
    *
    (1 row)
    ```

    If the command line returns something different, enable remote
    connections for your database with the following query:

    ``` bash
    ALTER SYSTEM SET listen_addresses = '*';
    ```

-   Change your IPv4 local connection to `0.0.0.0/0` to allow all
    incoming IP addresses.

    Find the `pg_hba.conf` configuration file using the following query:

    ``` bash
    SHOW hba_file;
    ```

    Open `pg_hba.conf` in a text editor of your choice, for example,
    Visual Studio Code.

    ``` bash
    code pg_hba.conf
    ```

    Under `IPv4 local connections`, find and replace the IP address with
    `0.0.0.0/0`.

    ``` bash
    # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

    # IPv4 local connections:
    host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5
    # IPv6 local connections:
    host    all             all             ::/0                    md5
    ```

    :::note[See also]
    For more details on the configuration file's syntax, see [The
    pg_hba.conf
    File](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).
    :::

-   Enable the logical replication.

    For cloud-hosted databases, the logical replication is usually
    enabled by default, while databases hosted on-premises can have the
    logical replication not enabled.

    Check that the logical replication is enabled using `psql` to run
    the following query:

    ``` bash
    SHOW wal_level;
    ```

    ```bash title="Expected output if enabled"
    wal_level
    -----------
    logical
    (1 row)
    ```

    If the command prompt returns something different, enable the
    logical replication in your database by setting `wal_level` to
    `logical`:

    ``` bash
    ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
    ```

-   Set the maximum number of replication slots to a value that is equal
    to or greater than the number of databases in the PostgreSQL server.

    Check the current status using the following query:

    ``` bash
    SHOW max_replication_slots;
    ```

    You can expect the following output:

    ``` bash
    max_replication_slots
    -----------
    <number of slots, for example, 8>
    (1 row)
    ```

    If `number of slots` is smaller than the number of databases in your
    PostgreSQL server, modify it using the following query:

    ``` bash
    ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = use_your_number;
    ```

    where `use_your_number` stands for the number of databases in your
    server.

-   Restart your PostgreSQL server using the following command:

    ``` bash
    sudo service postgresql restart
    ```

## Migrate a database {#migrate-in-console}

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
2.  On the **Services** page, select the service where your target
    database is located.
3.  From the sidebar on your service's page, select **Service
    settings**.
4.  On the **Service settings** page, navigate to the **Service
    management** section, and select **Import database**.
5.  Guided by the migration wizard, go through all the migration steps.

### Step 1: Configure

Get familiar with the guidelines provided in the **PostgreSQL migration
configuration guide** window, make sure your configuration is in line
with them, and select **Get started**.

### Step 2: Validation

1.  To establish a connection to your source database, enter required
    database details in the **Database connection and validation**
    window:
    -   Hostname
    -   Port
    -   Database name
    -   Username
    -   Password
2.  Select the **SSL encryption (recommended)** checkbox.
3.  Optionally, exclude specific databases from the migration by
    entering their names (separated with spaces) into the **Exclude
    databases** field.
4.  Select **Run check**.

:::note[Cannot migrate the database using logical replication?]
If your connection test returns information that you cannot migrate the
database using the logical replication due to the missing superuser
permissions or `aiven_extras` extension, you can still migrate your data
using the dump method.

To start a dump, select checkbox **Start the migration using a one-time
snapshot (dump method)**.
:::

### Step 3: Migration

If all the checks pass with no error messages, you are ready to start
the migration. Before you do that, make sure you understand its
limitations and consequences.

:::note[Impact on target databases]
It's recommended to migrate into an empty database. If you migrate into
a populated database, colliding tables with primary keys are not
affected, but tables without primary keys are appended. Check other
limitations in [Logical replication
restrictions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-restrictions.html).
:::

Trigger the migration by selecting **Start migration** in the **Database
migration** window.

While the migration is in progress, you can take the following actions:

-   Let it proceed until completed by selecting **Close window**, which
    closes the wizard. You can come back to check the status at any time
    on the **Service settings** page \> the **Service management**
    section \> **Import database**.
-   Write to the target database.
-   Discontinue the migration by selecting **Stop migration**. Although
    the data already migrated is retained, you cannot restart the
    stopped process. To continue with the migration, you need to start a
    new migration process from scratch.

:::warning
To avoid conflicts and replication issues while the migration is
ongoing, take the following precautions:

-   Do not write to any tables in the target database that are being
    processed by the migration tool.
-   Do not change the replication configuration of the source database
    manually. Do not modify `wal_level` or reduce
    `max_replication_slots`.
-   Do not make database changes that could disrupt or prevent the
    connection between the source database and the target database. Do
    not change the listen address of the source database and do not
    modify or enable firewalls on the databases.
:::

:::note[Migration attempt failed?]
If you happen to get such a notification, investigate potential causes
of the failure and try to fix the issues. When you are ready, trigger
the migration again by selecting **Start over**.
:::

### Step 4: Close

As soon as the wizard communicates the completion of the migration,
check if there's also information about the replication mode being
active.

:::note[Replication mode active]
This information in the wizard means that your data has been transferred
to Aiven, but some new data is still continuously being synced between
the connected databases.
:::

-   If there is no replication in progress, select **Close connection**
    in the migration wizard to finalize the migration process. As a
    result, on the **Service settings** page \> the **Service
    management** section \> **Import database**, you\'ll see the
    **Ready** tag.
-   If the replication mode is active, you can select **Keep
    replicating**. As a result, on the **Service settings** page \> the
    **Service management** section \> **Import database**, you\'ll see
    the **Syncing** tag, and you\'ll be able to check the status of the
    migration process by selecting **Status update**.

You have successfully migrated your PostgreSQL database into you Aiven
for PostgreSQL service.

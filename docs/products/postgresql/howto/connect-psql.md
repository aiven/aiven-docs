title: Connect with psql
---

`psql` is a command line tool for PostgreSQLÂ®, useful to manage and
query your database.

## Variables

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

| Variable         | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRESQL_URI` | URL for PostgreSQL connection, from the service overview page |

## Prerequisites

For this example you'll need `psql` already installed on your computer

## Connect to PostgreSQL

From your terminal, execute the following code:

```
psql POSTGRESQL_URI
```

The output should look like the following if the connection is
successful:

```
psql (13.2, server 13.3)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

defaultdb=>
```

To confirm that the connection is working, issue the following code
checking the PostgreSQL version:

```
select version();
```

The result will be similar to the following:

```
version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL 13.3 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc, a 68c5366192 p 6520304dc1, 64-bit
(1 row)
```

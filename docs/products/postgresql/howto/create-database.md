title: Create additional PostgreSQL® databases
---

Once you've created your Aiven for PostgreSQL® service, you can add
additional databases, whether for security purposes or to isolate your
data per application.

To create a new PostgreSQL® database:

1.  In the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), on the
    **Services** page, click the Aiven for PostgreSQL service name
    for which you want to create a new database.

2.  In your service's page, select **Databases** from the sidebar.

3.  In the **Databases** page, select **Create database**.

4.  In the **Create a new database** window, enter a name for your
    database into the **Name** field, and select **Add database**.

    The new database is visible immediately.

You can also use the
[Aiven client](/docs/tools/cli/service/database#avn-service-database-create) or the
[PostgreSQL client](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/connect-psql) to create your database from the CLI.

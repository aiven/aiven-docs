title: Detect and terminate long-running queries
---

Aiven does not terminate any customer queries even if they run
indefinitely, but long-running queries can cause issues by locking
resources and therefore preventing database maintenance tasks.

To identify and terminate such long-running queries, you can do it from
either:

-   [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io)
-   [PostgreSQLÂ®
    shell](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)
    (`psql`)

## Terminate long running queries from the Aiven Console

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
2.  From the **Services** page, select your Aiven for PostgreSQL
    service.
3.  In your service's page, select **Current queries** from the
    sidebar.
4.  In the **Current queries** page, you can check the query duration
    and select **Terminate** to stop any long-running queries.

## Detect and terminate long running queries with `psql`

You can
[login to your service](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/connect-psql) by running on the terminal `psql <service_uri>`. Once
connected, you can call the following function on the `psql` shell to
terminate a query manually:

```
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);
```

You can learn more about the `pg_terminate_backend()` function from the
[official
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html).

You can then use the following query to monitor currently running
queries:

```
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state <> 'idle';
```

Client applications can use the `statement_timeout` session variable to
voluntarily request the server to automatically cancel any query using
the current connection that runs over a specified length of time. For
example, the following would cancel any query that runs for more 15
seconds automatically:

```
SET statement_timeout = 15000
```

You may check the [client connection
defaults](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html)
documentation for more information on the available session variables.

## Database user error

If you run the above command using a database user not being a member of
the database you're connecting to, you will encounter the error:

```
ERROR:  must be a member of the role whose process is being terminated or member of pg_signal_backend
```

You can check the roles assigned to each user with the following
command:

```
SELECT r.rolname as username,r1.rolname as "role"
FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles r
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_auth_members m
        ON (m.member = r.oid)
    JOIN pg_roles r1 ON (m.roleid=r1.oid)
WHERE r.rolcanlogin
ORDER BY 1;
```

where you would see the following:

```
username |        role
----------+---------------------
avnadmin | pg_read_all_stats
avnadmin | pg_stat_scan_tables
(3 rows)
```

To be able to check the database owner and grant the role, you can run
the following:

```
\l
```

which you should see the role:

```
Name    |  Owner   |
-----------+----------+
testdb    | testrole |
```

To resolve the permission issue, you may grant the user the appropriate
role as per below:

```
grant testrole to avnadmin;
```

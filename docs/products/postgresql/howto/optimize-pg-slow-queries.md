Aiven for PostgreSQL allows you to [identify slow queries](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/identify-pg-slow-queries) using the `pg_stat_statements` view.

:::important
You can also use [Aiven's AI capabilities](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/ai-insights)
to identify and speed up slow queries.

## Limit the number of indexes

Having many database indexes on a table can reduce write performance
due to the overhead of maintaining them.

## Handle an increase in database connections

When your application code scales horizontally to accommodate high
loads, you might find that you inadvertently reach the
[connection limits](/docs/products/postgresql/reference/pg-connection-limits) for your
plan. Each connection in PostgreSQL runs in a
separate process, and this makes them more expensive (compared to
threads, for example) in terms of inter-process communication and memory
usage, since each connection consumes a certain amount of RAM.

In such cases, you can use the
[connection pooling](/docs/products/postgresql/concepts/pg-connection-pooling),
based on [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org), to handle
an increase in database connections. You can add and configure the
connection pooling for your service in the <ConsoleLabel name="pools"/> view in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

## Move read-only queries to standby nodes

If your Aiven for PostgreSQL速 service is running a Business or
Premium plan, you have one or more standby nodes available in a high
availability setup in the same cloud region.

To reduce the effect of slow queries on the primary node, you can
redirect read-only queries to the additional
[read-only](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/create-read-replica) nodes by
directly connecting via the **read-only replica URL**.

## Move read-only queries to a remote read-only replica

You can also create a
[remote read-only replica](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/create-read-replica) service in the same or a different
cloud or region that you can use to reduce the query load on the primary service
for read-only queries.

title: Use the PostgreSQL® dblink extension
---

`dblink` is a [PostgreSQL®
extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/dblink.html) that
allows you to connect to other PostgreSQL databases and to run arbitrary
queries.

With [Foreign Data
Wrappers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/postgres-fdw.html)
(FDW) you can uniquely define a remote **foreign server** in order to
access its data. The database connection details like hostnames are kept
in a single place, and you only need to create once a **user mapping**
storing remote connections credentials.

## Prerequisites

To create a `dblink` foreign data wrapper you need the following
information about the PostgreSQL remote server:

-   `TARGET_PG_HOST`: The remote database hostname
-   `TARGET_PG_PORT`: The remote database port
-   `TARGET_PG_USER`: The remote database user to connect
-   `TARGET_PG_PASSWORD`: The remote database password for the
    `TARGET_PG_USER`
-   `TARGET_PG_DATABASE_NAME`: The remote database name

:::note
If you're using Aiven for PostgreSQL as remote server, the above
details are available in the [Aiven console](https://console.aiven.io/) > the service's **Overview** page or via the dedicated
`avn service get` command with the
[Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn_service_get).
:::

## Enable `dblink` extension on Aiven for PostgreSQL

To enable the `dblink` extension on an Aiven for PostgreSQL service:

-   Connect to the database with the `avnadmin` user. The following
    shows how to do it with `psql`, the service URI can be found in the
    [Aiven console](https://console.aiven.io/) the service's
    **Overview** page:

```
psql "postgres://avnadmin:[AVNADMIN_PWD]@[PG_HOST]:[PG_PORT]/[PG_DB_NAME]?sslmode=require"
```

:::tip
If you're using Aiven for PostgreSQL as remote server, you can connect
to a service with the `avnadmin` user with the `avn service cli` command
with the [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn-service-cli).
:::

-   Create the `dblink` extension

```
CREATE EXTENSION dblink;
```

## Create a foreign data wrapper using `dblink_fdw`

To create a foreign data wrapper using the `dblink_fwd` you need to
perform the following steps:

-   Connect to the database with the `avnadmin` user. The following
    shows how to do it with `psql`, the service URI can be found in the
    [Aiven console](https://console.aiven.io/) the service's
    **Overview** page:

```
psql "postgres://avnadmin:[AVNADMIN_PWD]@[PG_HOST]:[PG_PORT]/[PG_DB_NAME]?sslmode=require"
```

-   Create a user `user1` that will be access the `dblink`

```
CREATE USER user1 PASSWORD 'secret1'
```

-   Create a remote server definition (named `pg_remote`) using
    `dblink_fdw` and the target PostgreSQL connection details

```
CREATE SERVER pg_remote
    FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER dblink_fdw
    OPTIONS (
             host 'TARGET_PG_HOST',
             dbname 'TARGET_PG_DATABASE_NAME',
             port 'TARGET_PG_PORT'
             );
```

-   Create a user mapping for the `user1` to automatically authenticate
    as the `TARGET_PG_USER` when using the `dblink`

```
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR user1
    SERVER pg_remote
    OPTIONS (
        user 'TARGET_PG_USER',
        password 'TARGET_PG_PASSWORD'
        );
```

-   Enable `user1` to use the remote PostgreSQL connection `pg_remote`

```
GRANT USAGE ON FOREIGN SERVER pg_remote TO user1;
```

## Query data using a foreign data wrapper

To query a foreign data wrapper you must be a database user having the
necessary grants to the remote server definition. We can use `user1`
from the previous example. To query the remote table `inventory` defined
in the target PostgreSQL database pointed by the `pg_remote` server
definition:

-   Connect with the Aiven for PostgreSQL service with the database user
    (`user1`) having the necessary grants to the remote server
    definition
-   Establish the `dblink` connection to the remote target

```
SELECT dblink_connect('my_new_conn', 'pg_remote');
```

-   Execute the query passing the foreign server definition as parameter

```
SELECT * FROM dblink('pg_remote','SELECT item_id FROM inventory')
    AS target_inventory(target_item_id int);
```

-   Check the results

```text
target_item_id
----------------
            1
            2
            3
(3 rows)
```

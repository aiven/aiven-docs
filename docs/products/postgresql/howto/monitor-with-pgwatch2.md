title: Monitor PostgreSQL® metrics with pgwatch2
---

[pgwatch2](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pgwatch2) is an open
source monitoring solution for PostgreSQL®, created by CYBERTEC and can
be used to monitor instances of Aiven for PostgreSQL collecting key
PostgreSQL metrics and also gathering data from a wide range of
PostgreSQL extensions.

:::note
Aiven for PostgreSQL supports the most popular extensions, but, due to
security implications, can't support all the available extensions.
Check
[Extensions on Aiven for PostgreSQL®](/docs/products/postgresql/reference/list-of-extensions) and
[Extensions on Aiven for PostgreSQL®](/docs/products/postgresql/reference/list-of-extensions) for details on the supported PostgreSQL extensions on the
Aiven platform.

## Prepare an Aiven for PostgreSQL instance for pgwatch2

The following steps need to be executed on the Aiven for PostgreSQL
instance to be monitored with pgwatch2:

1.  Create a user for pgwatch2 (with a sensible password):

    ```
    CREATE USER pgwatch2 WITH PASSWORD 'password';
    ```

2.  Limit the number of connections from pgwatch2 (optional, but
    recommended in the [pgwatch2
    documentation](https://pgwatch2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)):

    ```
    ALTER ROLE pgwatch2 CONNECTION LIMIT 3;
    ```

3.  Allow pgwatch2 to read database statistics:

    ```
    GRANT pg_read_all_stats TO pgwatch2;
    ```

4.  If you want to collect data gathered from the `pg_stat_statements`
    extension, it needs to be enabled:

    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
    ```

5.  The [pgwatch2
    documentation](https://pgwatch2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    recommends to enable timing of database I/O calls by setting the
    PostgreSQL configuration parameter `track_io_timing` (see
    [Extensions on Aiven for PostgreSQL®](/docs/products/postgresql/reference/list-of-extensions)).

    :::warning
    According to the [PostgreSQL
    documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html),
    setting `track_io_timing = on` can cause significant overhead.

## Running pgwatch2

pgwatch2 has multiple [installation
options](https://pgwatch2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_options.html)
to choose from. For the sake of simplicity, the following example uses
[ad-hoc
mode](https://pgwatch2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_options.html#ad-hoc-mode)
with a Docker container:

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 \
    -e PW2_ADHOC_CONN_STR='postgres://pgwatch2:password@HOST:PORT/defaultdb?sslmode=require' \
    -e PW2_ADHOC_CONFIG='rds' --name pw2 cybertec/pgwatch2-postgres
```

This runs pgwatch2 with the container image provided by CYBERTEC.
`PW2_ADHOC_CONN_STR` is set to the connection string of the PostgreSQL
instance to be monitored, copied from the [Aiven web
console](https://console.aiven.io/) replacing the username/password have
been replaced by the ones specifically created for pgwatch2. Please
consult the [pgwatch2
documentation](https://pgwatch2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to decide on
the best way to set up pgwatch2 in your environment.

:::note
pgwatch2 contains several dashboards that rely on extensions not
available in Aiven for PostgreSQL, so it is to be expected that some
dashboards are either empty or display error symbols.

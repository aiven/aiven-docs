title: Claim public schema ownership

When an Aiven for PostgreSQLÂ® instance is created, the `public` schema
is owned by the `postgres` user that is available only to Aiven for
management purposes. If changes to the `public` schema are required, you
can claim the ownership using the `aiven_extras` extension as the
`avnadmin` database user.

1.  Enable the `aiven_extras` extension:

    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION aiven_extras CASCADE;
    ```

2.  Claim the public schema ownership with the dedicated
    `claim_public_schema_ownership` function:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM aiven_extras.claim_public_schema_ownership();
    ```

Now the `avnadmin` user owns the public schema and can modify it.

title: Access PgBouncer statistics
---

PgBouncer is used at Aiven for [connection pooling](/docs/products/postgresql/concepts/pg-connection-pooling).

## Get PgBouncer URL

PgBouncer URL can be checked under **Pools** in [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/)
\> your Aiven for PostgreSQLÂ® service's page > **Pools** view (available from the sidebar).
Alternatively, it can be extracted via [Aiven Command Line interface](/docs/tools/cli),
using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to parse the JSON response.

Execute the following command replacing the `INSTANCE_NAME` parameter
with the name of your instance:

```bash
avn service get INSTANCE_NAME --project PROJECT_NAME --json | jq -r '.connection_info.pgbouncer'
```

The output will be similar to the below:

```text
postgres://avnadmin:xxxxxxxxxxx@demo-pg-dev-advocates.aivencloud.com:13040/pgbouncer?sslmode=require
```

## Connect to PgBouncer

To connect to PgBouncer, use the extracted URL:

```sql
psql 'EXTRACTED_PGBOUNCER_URL'
```

## Access statistics

Enable the expanded display by running:

```sql
pgbouncer=# \x
```

Show the statistics by running:

```sql
pgbouncer=# SHOW STATS;
```

Depending on the load of your database, the output will be similar to:

```text
database  | total_xact_count | total_query_count | total_received | total_sent | total_xact_time | total_query_time | total_wait_time | avg_xact_count | avg_query_count | avg_recv | avg_sent | avg_xact_time | avg_query_time | avg_wait_time
----------+------------------+-------------------+----------------+------------+-----------------+------------------+-----------------+----------------+-----------------+----------+----------+---------------+----------------+---------------
pgbouncer |                1 |                 1 |              0 |          0 |               0 |                0 |               0 |              0 |               0 |        0 |        0 |             0 |              0 |             0
(1 row)
```

Run `SHOW HELP` to see all available commands. Only read-only access is
available, as PgBouncer pools are automatically managed by Aiven.

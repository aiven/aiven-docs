title: Identify and repair issues with PostgreSQL® indexes with REINDEX
---

PostgreSQL® indexes can become corrupted due to a variety of reasons
including software bugs, hardware failures or unexpected duplicated
data. `REINDEX` allows you to rebuild the index in such situations.

## Rebuild non-unique indexes

You can rebuild corrupted indexes that do not have `UNIQUE` in their
definition using the following command, that creates a new index
replacing the old one:

```
REINDEX INDEX <index-name>;
```

:::warning
Re-indexing applies locks to the table and may interfere with normal use
of the database. In some cases, it can be useful to manually build a
second index concurrently alongside the old index and then remove the
old index:

```
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY foo_index_new ON table_a (...);
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY foo_index_old;
ALTER INDEX foo_index_new RENAME TO foo_index;
```
:::

You can run the `REINDEX` command for:

-   all indexes of a table (`REINDEX TABLE`)
-   all indexes in the entire database (`REINDEX DATABASE`).

For more information on the `REINDEX` command, see the [PostgreSQL
documentation
page](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-reindex.html).

## Rebuild unique indexes

A `UNIQUE` index works on top of one or more columns whose combination
is unique in a table. In situations when the index is corrupted or
disabled and duplicated physical rows appear in the table, breaking the
uniqueness constraint of the index, then index rebuilding with `REINDEX`
will fail. To solve such a problem, you'll first need to remove the
duplicated rows from the table before attempting to rebuild the index.

### Identify conflicting duplicated rows

To identify conflicting duplicate rows, you need to run a query that
counts the number of rows for each combination of columns included in
the index definition.

For example, the following `route` table has a `unique_route_index`
index defining unique rows based on the combination of the `source` and
`destination` columns:

```
CREATE TABLE route(
    source TEXT,
    destination TEXT,
    description TEXT
    );

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_route_index
    ON route (source, destination);
```

If the `unique_route_index` is corrupted, you can find duplicated rows
in the `route` table by issuing the following query:

```
SELECT
    source,
    destination,
    count
FROM
    (SELECT
        source,
        destination,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM route
    GROUP BY
        source,
        destination) AS foo
WHERE count > 1;
```

The above query groups the data by the same `source` and `destination`
fields defined in the index, and filters any entries with more than one
occurrence.

The resulting rows identify the problematic entries, which must be
resolved manually by deleting or merging the entries until no duplicates
exist. Once duplicated entries are removed, you can use the `REINDEX`
command to rebuild the index.

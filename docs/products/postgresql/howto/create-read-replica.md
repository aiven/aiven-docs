title: Create and use read-only replicas
---

PostgreSQLÂ® read-only replicas provide a great way to reduce the load on
the primary server by enabling read-only queries to be performed against
the replica. It's also a good way to optimise query response times
across different geographical locations since, with Aiven, the replica
can be placed in different regions or even different cloud providers.

:::note
If your service is running a `business-*` or `premium-*` plan, you have
standby nodes available in a high availability setup. These support
read-only queries to reduce the effect of slow queries on the primary
node.

## Create a replica

To set up a remote replica:

1.  Log in to the [Aiven web console](https://console.aiven.io/).
2.  Select the PostgreSQL instance for which you want to create a remote
    replica.
3.  In the **Overview** page of your service, select **Create replica**.

4.  Enter a name for the remote replica and select the cloud provider,
    region, and Aiven for PostgreSQL service plan that you want to use,
    then select **Create**.

The read-only replica is created and added to the list of services in
your project. The **Overview** page of the replica indicates the name of
the primary service for the replica.

Read-only replicas can be manually promoted to become the master
database if the need arises. For more complex high availability and
failover scenarios check the
[related documentation](/docs/products/postgresql/concepts/high-availability).

:::tip
You can promote a read-replica to master using the API endpoint to
[delete the service
integration](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#operation/ServiceIntegrationDelete)
and passing the `integration_id` of the replica service.

Deleting the integration that comes with `integration_type` of value
`read_replica` will lead to the service to no longer be a read-replica,
hence becoming the master.

## Use a replica

To use a read only replica:

1.  Log in to the Aiven web console and select your PostgreSQL service.

2.  In the **Overview** page, copy the **Replica URI** an use it to
    connect via `psql`:

    ```
    psql POSTGRESQL_REPLICA_URI
    ```

## Identify replica status

To check whether you are connected to a primary or replica node, run the
following command within a `psql` terminal already connected to a
database:

```
SELECT * FROM pg_is_in_recovery();
```

If the above command returns `TRUE` if you are connected to the replica,
and `FALSE` if you are connected to the primary server.

:::warning
Aiven for PostgreSQL uses asynchronous replication and so a small lag is
expected. When running an `INSERT` operation on the primary node, a
minimal delay (usually less than a second) can be expected for the
change to be propagated to the replica and to be visible there.

## Read-replica for disaster recovery

High availability enables data distribution across availability zones
within a single region. To accomplish that without a default
multi-region service with node allocation spanning multiple regions, you
can take the following steps:

-   Establish a high-availability Aiven for PostgreSQL service within a
    single region.
-   Configure a remote read-only replica in a different region or even
    on an alternate cloud platform.

As a result, you introduce an additional node in the distinct
region/cloud. Since this node does not work as a hot standby node, you
might want to promote it manually to the primary role, which makes it
operate as an independent standalone service.

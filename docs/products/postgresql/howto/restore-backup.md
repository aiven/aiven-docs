title: Restore PostgreSQL® from a backup
---

Aiven for PostgreSQL® databases are automatically backed up and can be
restored from a backup at any point in time within the **backup
retention period**, which
[varies by plan](/docs/products/postgresql/concepts/pg-backups). The restore is created by \"Forking\": a new PostgreSQL
instance is created and content from the original database is restored
into it.

:::note
Aiven for PostgreSQL doesn't allow a service to be rolled back to a
backup in-place since it creates alternative timelines for the database,
adding complexity for the user.
:::

To restore a PostgreSQL database, take the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
2.  Select your Aiven for PostgreSQL service from the **Services** page.
3.  Select **Service settings** from the sidebar of your service's
    page.
4.  Navigate to the **Service management** section, and select **Fork
    database** from the **Actions** (**...**) menu.
5.  Enter a service name, and choose a project name, database version,
    cloud region and plan for the new instance.
6.  Select the **Source service state** defining the backup point, the
    options are as follows:
    -   **Latest transaction**
    -   **Point in time** - the date selector allows to chose a precise
        point in time within the available backup retention period.
7.  With all the fork settings configured, select **Create fork**.

Once the new service is running, you can change your application's
connection settings to point to it.

:::tip
Forked services can also be very useful for testing purposes, allowing
you to create a completely realistic, separate copy of the actual
production database with its data.
:::

## Manual restores

Manual restoration should only be necessary when data is accidentally
corrupted by the pointing applications. Aiven automatically handles
outages and software failures by replacing broken nodes with new ones
that resume correctly from the point of failure.

:::note
The Hobbyist service plan does not support database forking, so you have
to use an external tool, such as `pg_dump`, to perform a backup.

To perform a manual backup, see
[Create manual PostgreSQL® backups](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/create-manual-backups).

title: "Sample dataset for PostgreSQL®: Pagila"
---

Aiven provides a sample database you can import in your Aiven for
PostgreSQL® service. This page covers information about the database and
the procedure to get it up and running.

Pagila is a PostgreSQL® port of the [Sakila Sample
Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/). The examples here use
one from `devrimgunduz`, [version
2.1.0](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila).

Sakila (and thus, Pagila) is a database representing a DVD rental store
(remember those?!), containing information about films (like title,
category, actresses), rental stores (like address, staff members,
customers) and rentals, where a customer rents a film from a store
through its staff.

With all these relational information, Pagila is a perfect fit to play
around with PostgreSQL and the SQL language.

## Load Pagila to your Aiven for PostgreSQL service

Before exploring the Pagila database, follow the
[create new service article](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service) to spin up a PostgreSQL instance.

1.  Download the `pagila-data.sql` from our [GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/aiven/devportal/blob/main/code/products/postgresql/pagila/pagila-data.sql).

    :::tip
    You may use the following command on your terminal:

    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiven/devportal/main/code/products/postgresql/pagila/pagila-data.sql
    ```
    :::

2.  Connect to the PostgreSQL instance using the following command. The
    `SERVICE_URI` value can be found in the Aiven Console dashboard.

    ```shell
    psql 'SERVICE_URI'
    ```

3.  Within the `psql` shell, create a database named `pagila` and
    connect to it with the command below:

    ```psql
    CREATE DATABASE pagila;
    \c pagila;
    ```

4.  Populate the database with the command below. This might take some
    time.

    ```psql
    \i pagila-data.sql;
    ```

5.  Once the command finishes, make sure to reconnect to the database to
    access the imported data:

    ```psql
    \c pagila;
    ```

## Entity-relationship model diagram

The image below shows an overview of the Pagila database tables and
views, generated by [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io).

Here you can see how the tables relate to each other, through each
fields. For example, the `film` table has string columns like `title`
and `description`. It also relates to the table `language` with the
columns `language_id` and `original_language_id`. With that information,
you know that you can join both tables to get the language of each film,
or to list all films for a specific language.

## Ready for a challenge?

After playing around with the sample queries, can you use SQL statements
to answer some of these questions?

1.  What is the total revenue of each rental store?

<details><summary>
See answer
</summary>

```sql
select
    store.store_id,
    sum(payment.amount) as "total revenue"
from
    store
left join inventory on
    inventory.store_id = store.store_id
left join rental on
    rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
left join payment on
    payment.rental_id = rental.rental_id
where
    payment.amount is not null
group by
    store.store_id
order by
    sum(payment.amount) desc;
```

```text

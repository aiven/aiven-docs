title: Restrict access to databases or tables in Aiven for PostgreSQL®
---

You can restrict access to Aiven for PostgreSQL® databases and tables by
setting up read-only permissions for specific user's roles.

## Set read-only access in a schema

1.  Modify default permissions for a user's role in a particular
    schema.

```bash
alter default privileges for role name_of_role in schema name_of_schema YOUR_GRANT_OR_REVOKE_PERMISSIONS
```

2.  Apply the new read-only access setting to your existing database
    objects that uses the affected schema.

```bash
grant select on all tables in schema name_of_schema to NAME_OF_READ_ONLY_ROLE
```

## Set read-only access in a database

You can set up the read-only access for a specific user's role in a
particular database.

1.  Create a new database which will be used as a template
    `create database ro_<name>_template...`.
2.  For the new template database, set permissions and roles that you
    want as default ones in the template.
3.  When creating a new database, use
    `create database NAME with template = 'ro_<name>_template'`.

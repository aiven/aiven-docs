Shift your workloads back to the primary region, where your service was hosted originally before failing over to the recovery region. Restore your CRDR setup.

## Prerequisites

- [CRDR failover](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-failover-to-recovery) completed
- One of the following tools for operating CRDR:
  - [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/)
  - [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli)
  - [Aiven API](/docs/tools/api)

## Revert to the primary region

Initiate a
[revert process](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#revert-to-the-primary-region)
using a tool of your choice:

<Tabs groupId="group1">
<TabItem value="console" label="Aiven Console" default>

1. Log in to the the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), and go to your primary
   Aiven for PostgreSQL service.
1. Click <ConsoleLabel name="disasterrecovery"/> in the sidebar.
1. On the **Cross region disaster recovery** page, click **Manage**.
1. In **Disaster recovery cycle** wizard:

   1. Click **Restore primary service**.

      This puts the primary service in the **Rebuilding** state. As soon as **Rebuilding**
      changes to **Passive**, consider your primary service recreated and proceed to
      the next step.

   1. Click **Promote primary to active**.

      This takes effect when the primary service becomes **Active** and the recovery service
      becomes **Passive**, which means traffic and replication direction are switched back
      to the recreated primary service and your CRDR setup is restored to its original
      configuration.

   1. Click **Done**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Aiven CLI">

1. Restore the primary service by running
   [avn byoc update](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn-cli-service-update):

   ```bash
   avn service update PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME \
      --disaster-recovery-role passive
   ```

   Replace `PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME` with the name of the primary service, for example, `pg-demo`.

1. Promote the primary service as active by running
   [avn byoc update](/docs/tools/cli/service-cli#avn-cli-service-update):

   ```bash
   avn service update PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME \
      --disaster-recovery-role active
   ```

   Replace `PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME` with the name of the primary service, for example, `pg-demo`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="Aiven API">

1. Trigger the recreation of the primary service by calling the
   [ServiceUpdte endpoint](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#tag/Service/operation/ServiceUpdate)
   to change `disaster_recovery_role` of the primary service to `passive`:

   ```bash {5}
   curl --request PUT \
   --url https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/PROJECT_NAME/service/PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer BEARER_TOKEN' \
   -H 'content-type: application/json' \
   --data '{"disaster_recovery_role": "passive"}'
   ```

   Replace the following placeholders with meaningful data:

   - `PROJECT_NAME`, for example `crdr-test`
   - `PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME`, for example `pg-primary-test`
   - `BEARER_TOKEN`

   After sending the request, you can check the CRDR status on each of the CRDR peer services:

   - Primary service status

      ```bash
      avn service get pg-primary
         --project $PROJECT_NAME
         --json | jq '{state: .state, disaster_recovery_role: .disaster_recovery_role}'
      ```

      Expect the following output:

      ```json
      {
        "state": "REBUILDING",
        "disaster_recovery_role": "passive"
      }
      ```

   - Recovery service status

      ```bash
      avn service get pg-primary-dr
      --project $PROJECT_NAME
      --json | jq '{state: .state, disaster_recovery_role: .disaster_recovery_role}'
      ```

      Expect the following output:

      ```json
      {
        "state": "RUNNING",
        "disaster_recovery_role": "active"
      }
      ```

1. Promote the primary service as active by calling the
   [ServiceUpdte endpoint](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#tag/Service/operation/ServiceUpdate)
   to change `disaster_recovery_role` of the primary service to `active`:

   ```bash {5}
   curl --request PUT \
   --url https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/PROJECT_NAME/service/PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer BEARER_TOKEN' \
   -H 'content-type: application/json' \
   --data '{"disaster_recovery_role": "active"}'
   ```

   Replace the following placeholders with meaningful data:

   - `PROJECT_NAME`, for example `crdr-test`
   - `PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME`, for example `pg-primary-test`
   - `BEARER_TOKEN`

   After sending the request, you can check the CRDR status on each of the CRDR peer services:

   - Primary service status

      ```bash
      avn service get pg-primary
      --project $PROJECT_NAME
      --json | jq '{state: .state, disaster_recovery_role: .disaster_recovery_role}'
      ```

      Expect the following output:

      ```json
      {
        "state": "RUNNING",
        "disaster_recovery_role": "active"
      }
      ```

   - Recovery service status

      ```bash
      avn service get pg-primary-dr
      --project $PROJECT_NAME
      --json | jq '{state: .state, disaster_recovery_role: .disaster_recovery_role}'
      ```

      Expect the following output:

      ```json
      {
        "state": "RUNNING",
        "disaster_recovery_role": "passive"
      }
      ```

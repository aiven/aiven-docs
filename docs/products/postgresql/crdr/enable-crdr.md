Enable the [cross-region disaster recovery (CRDR)](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview) feature in in Aiven for PostgreSQL速 by creating a recovery service, which takes over from a primary service in case of region outage.

## Prerequisites

- Powered-on Aiven for PostgreSQL service with a Startup plan at minimum

  :::tip
  If your Aiven for PostgreSQL service uses a Hobbyist plan or a Free plan,
  [upgrade your free plan](/docs/platform/concepts/free-plan#upgrading-and-downgrading) or
  [change your Hobbyist plan](/docs/platform/howto/scale-services) to at least a Startup
  plan.
  :::

- Access to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/)

## Set up a recovery service

Create a [CRDR setup](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#crdr-setup) in the the
[Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/):

1. Log in to the the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), and go to your primary
   Aiven for PostgreSQL service.
1. Click <ConsoleLabel name="disasterrecovery"/> in the sidebar.
1. On the **Cross region disaster recovery** page, click **Create recovery service**.
1. In **Create recovery service** wizard:
   1. Select a cloud provider and a cloud region.
   1. Click **Create recovery service**.

Througout the process of creating the recovery service, the recovery service is in the
**Rebuilding** state. As soon as the recovery service is ready, its status changes to
**Passive**, which means your CRDR setup is up and running.

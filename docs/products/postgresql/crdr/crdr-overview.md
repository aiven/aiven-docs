The cross-region disaster recovery (CRDR) feature ensures your business continuity by recovering your workloads to a remote region in the event of a region-wide
failure.

## Region-wide outage

CRDR allows you to cope with the primary region failure by initiating a recovery transition
to another region. To identify a region outage, look into the region status:

- Check your monitoring and alerts, and watch the following metrics:
  - Instances, nodes, services failures
  - Connectivity loss, latency spikes, packet drops
  - High error rates, timeouts, 5xx server errors
- Check your cloud provider's status page:
  - [AWS](https://health.aws.amazon.com)
  - [Google Cloud](https://status.cloud.google.com)
  - [Azure](https://status.azure.com)
- Test connectivity and DNS resolution for your instances or services.

## CRDR overview

The CRDR setup is a pair of integrated multi-node services, sharing credentials and a
DNS address but located in different regions. CRDR peer services can be hosted on 1-3 nodes.

- **Primary service** hosted in the primary region is your original service you use on
  regular basis. It hands over to the recovery service when you initiate
  [a failover or a switchover](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#recovery-transition).
  When you initiate
  [a failback or a switchback](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#recovery-reversion),
  the primary service takes back control from the recovery service as soon as the
  infrastructure is up and running again.
- **Recovery service** hosted in the recovery region is the service you create for
  disaster recovery purposes. It takes over from the primary service when you initiate
  [a failover or a switchover](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#recovery-transition).
  When you initiate
  [a failback or a switchback](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#recovery-reversion),
  the recovery service hands over to the primary service as soon as the infrastructure is
  up and running again.

The CRDR cycle is a sequence of actions involving CRDR peer services aimed at enabling and
executing CRDR as well as resuming the original service operation.

Throughout the CRDR cycle, CRDR peer services or service nodes go into the following states:

- **Active**: A CRDR peer service is *active* when it runs on a node that is replicating data to
  CRDR standby nodes.
  - Primary service is active during normal operations, when a region is up and running.
  - Recovery service is active after taking over from primary service in the event of a region outage.

- **Passive**: A CRDR peer service is *passive* when it runs on CRDR standby nodes only. Either CRDR
  peer service can be passive depending on a phase of the CRDR cycle.

- **Failed**: A CRDR peer service is *failed* when it's defunct or unreachable after failing over
  in the event of a region outage. Only a primary service can be failed.

## Limitations

- To set up CRDR, your primary service needs at least a Startup plan. Hobbyist and Free
  plans are not supported.
- Recovery service needs to use the same service plan and cloud provider as the primary service.

## How it works

The CRDR feature is eligible for all startup, business, and premium service plans.

### CRDR setup

You [enable CRDR by creating a recovery service](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/enable-crdr).
The CRDR setup completes as soon as the recovery service is created and in sync with the
primary service. At that point, the primary service is the **Active** service receiving
incoming traffic and replicating to the recovery service, and the recovery service is the
**Passive** service replicating from the primary service.

### Recovery transition

CRDR supports two types of the recovery transition:

- [Failover](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#failover-to-the-recovery-region)
  - **Triggered by you** typically in the event of a region-wide outage
  - **Destroys the primary service** and requires the primary service recreation to fail back.
- [Switchover](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#switchover-to-the-recovery-region)
  - **Triggered by you** for any purposes other than a region-wide outage
  - Leaves the **primary service intact** with no need for recreating it to switch back.

#### Failover to the recovery region

You typically trigger a
[failover to the recovery region](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/failover/crdr-failover-to-recovery)
in the event of a region-wide outage. This destroys the primary service, which becomes
**Failed**, and promotes the recovery service to **Active**. To fail back to
the primary service, it needs to be recreated first.

#### Switchover to the recovery region

You trigger a
[switchover to the recovery service](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/switchover/crdr-switchover)
for testing, simulating a disaster scenario, or verifying the disaster resilience of your
infrastructure. This demotes the primary service to **Passive** and promotes the recovery
service to **Active**. To switch back to the primary service, no service recreation is
needed.

### Recovery reversion

You trigger a recovery reversion to shift your workload back to the primary region and
restore the CRDR setup to its original configuration.

There are two types of the recovery reversion:

- [Failback](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#failback-to-the-primary-region)
  - Reverts a
    [failover](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#failover-to-the-recovery-region).
  - Recreates the primary service.
- [Switchback](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#switchback-to-the-primary-region)
  - Reverts a
    [switchover](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/crdr-overview#switchover-to-the-recovery-region).
  - No need to recreate the primary service.

#### Failback to the primary region

The failback process consists of two steps you initiate at your convenience:

1. [Primary service recreation](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/failover/crdr-revert-to-primary)

   You initiate this step to restore primary service nodes from the local backups and to
   synchronize (replicate) the most recent data from the active service (recovery service).
   When completed, the primary service is restored and in near real-time sync with the recovery service.

1. [Primary service takeover](/docs/products/postgresql/crdr/failover/crdr-revert-to-primary)

   You initiate a takeover as soon as the primary service is recreated. This switches the direction of
   the replication to effectively route the traffic back to the primary region. When
   completed, both the primary service and the recovery service are up and running again: the primary service as an active
   service, and the recovery service as a passive service.

#### Switchback to the primary region

You initiate a switchback at your convenience to switch the direction of the
replication and route the traffic back to the primary region. When completed, both the primary service
and the recovery service are up and running again: the primary service as an active service, and the recovery service as a
passive service.

## DNS address and service URI

### Active service DNS address

CRDR allows you to access your active service always using the same **Service URI**,
which doesn't change in the event of a failover to the recovery region.

:::note
**Service URI** is a locator that is shared between the primary service and the recovery service. It always points
to the replicating node of the active service. This node is the only read-write node
in both CRDR regions.
:::

The **Service URI** of an active service can remain unchanged in the event of a region outage
because the DNS record of this **Service URI** is updated to point to the active service.
This allows your applications to work uninterrupted and adapt to the change automatically
without updating its code or data.

### Standby nodes DNS addresses

Regardless of the CRDR cycle phase, you can always connect and access separately
each standby node in the CRDR peer services. This can help you compensate for potential
network delays by using the service geographically closer to your applications.

Standby nodes in the CRDR service pair can have two different URIs, depending on the CRDR
service (region) they belong to:

- For the **primary service standby URI**, the DNS record always points to the standby nodes
  in the primary region.
- For the **recovery service standby URI**, the DNS record always points to the standby nodes
  in the recovery region.

Both the primary service standby URI and the recovery service standby URI are dedicated, not shared, and read-only.

## Backups in the recovery region

After a failover to the recovery region in the event of a primary region outage, service
backups start to be taken in the recovery region. You can use this backup history for
operations and data resiliency purposes.

---

Learn what Aiven for PostgreSQL® shared buffers are and why use them.
Find out how using shared buffers impacts performance and how to set
them up properly. Finally, discover how to inspect the database cache
performance and and the query cache performance and check out how to put
data into cache manually.

## About shared buffers

There are two primary memory allocations in Aiven for PostgreSQL that
drastically impact the performance of queries: `shared_buffers` (the
amount of RAM used for shared memory buffers) and `work_mem` (the
maximum amount of memory to be used by a query operation before writing
to temporary disk files).

### Purpose of shared buffers

The `shared_buffers` parameter controls the amount of memory allocated
to the database server for disk page caching. The primary purpose of
`shared_buffers` is to share memory over multiple sessions that may want
to access the same blocks concurrently. Managing the access using the
memory helps avoid unnecessary locking.

:::note
Even with `shared_buffers`, Aiven for PostgreSQL relies on the
filesystem cache for optimization so reading from the disk is still
needed.
:::

### Allocation and setup

`shared_buffers` is allocated only once at startup; thus, it's not
allocated per-session or per-user. It is shared among all sessions and
useable for each worker and, therefore, each query.

To obtain a good performance of a database server with 1 GB or more of
RAM, it is usually necessary to set this value to \~25% of the system
memory. For systems with less than 1 GB of RAM, a smaller portion of RAM
is preferable to allow for the operating system.

Allocating a lot of memory to `shared_buffers` is not always optimal for
your configuration since the remaining free memory is allocated to
workers (queries) and the filesystem cache. There are workloads where
large `shared_buffers` are effective, but the allocation of more than
40% is unlikely to work better than a smaller-amount allocation.

The optimal setting for any service depends on the available RAM, the
working data set, and the workload applied.

To examine the current `shared_buffers` value, run the following query:

```shell
SHOW shared_buffers;
```

## Tuning guidelines

Aiven for PostgreSQL actively tracks data access patterns, updates the
`shared_buffers` with frequently accessed data, and ejects Least
Recently Used (LRU) when necessary. With many applications, only a
fraction of the entire data set is accessed regularly. This data set
fraction can be referred to as a *working set* or a *frequent read set*
and often follows the 80/20 rule: 80% of the reads is in 20% of the
data.

:::tip
For optimal performance, a `shared_buffers` cache hit rate of 97-99% is
ideal.
:::

You can find an overview of `shared_buffers` cache hit rates using
`pg_statio_user_tables`:

```shell
SELECT * FROM pg_statio_user_tables;

relid | schemaname | relname | heap_blks_read | heap_blks_hit | idx_blks_read | idx_blks_hit | toast_blks_read | toast_blks_hit | tidx_blks_read | tidx_blks_hit
-------+------------+---------+----------------+---------------+---------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------+----------------+---------------
16415 | public     | records |        1042770 |      88157826 |        184280 |     40282404 |               0 |              0 |              0 |             0
(1 row)
```

Calculate the database cache hit rate with:

```shell
SELECT
  sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
  sum(heap_blks_hit)  as heap_hit,
  sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) as hit_ratio
FROM
  pg_statio_user_tables;

   heap_read | heap_hit |         ratio
  -----------+----------+------------------------
     6942770 | 88157826 | 0.9883098315
  (1 row)
```

If the cache hit rate is significantly lower than 95%, this may be an
indicator of several issues:

-   Insufficient data activity to generate accurate statistics (new
    database)
-   Current `shared_buffers_percentage` value too low
-   Size of the working set larger than the maximum available
    `shared_buffers_percentage` (60%)

To achieve an optimal performance, the working set needs to fit in
`shared buffers`.

While the `shared_buffers_percentage` has a maximum value of
`60%]{.title-ref}, exceeding a value of [40%` suggests more
RAM is required.

:::tip
In many cases, the Aiven default value of 20% requires no further
modification.

## Inspecting the database cache performance

For a deeper examination into the contents of the `shared_buffers`,
enable the `pg_buffercache` extension:

```shell
CREATE EXTENSION pg_buffercache;
```

Calculate how many blocks from tables (r), indexes (i), sequences (S),
and other objects are currently cached using the following query:

```shell
SELECT c.relname, c.relkind
  , pg_size_pretty(count(*) * 8193) as buffered
  , round(100.0 * count(*) / ( SELECT setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name='shared_buffers')::integer,1) AS buffers_percent
  , round(100.0 * count(*) * 8192 / pg_relation_size(c.oid),1) AS percent_of_relation
FROM pg_class c
INNER JOIN pg_buffercache b ON b.relfilenode = c.relfilenode
INNER JOIN pg_database d ON (b.reldatabase = d.oid AND d.datname = current_database())
WHERE c.oid >= 16384
AND pg_relation_size(c.oid) > 0
GROUP BY c.oid, c.relname
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;

 relname | relkind | buffered | buffers_percent | percent_of_relation
---------+---------+----------+-----------------+---------------------
 records | r       | 781 MB   |            99.7 |                27.2
```

Relations with object IDs (`oid`) below `16384` are reserved system
objects.

## Inspecting the query cache performance

Queries can also be inspected for the cache hit performance using
`EXPLAIN`:

```shell
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)
SELECT * from records;
                                                          QUERY PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seq Scan on public.records  (cost=0.00..480095.20 rows=11207220 width=77) (actual time=0.158..16863.051 rows=11600000 loops=1)
  Output: id, "timestamp", data
  Buffers: shared hit=92345 read=275678 dirtied=10938
Query Identifier: 2582883386000135492
Planning:
  Buffers: shared hit=30 dirtied=2
Planning Time: 1.081 ms
Execution Time: 17467.342 ms
(8 rows)
```

Using `hit / (hit + read)]{.title-ref} shows [\~25%` of this
full table scan was in the `shared_buffers`

## Putting data into the cache manually

You may want to prewarm the `shared_buffers` in anticipation of a
specific workload, such as a large analytical query set used for
reporting. This can be accomplished using the `pg_prewarm` extension.

```shell
CREATE EXTENSION pg_prewarm;
```

:::note[Example]
Call the `pg_prewarm` function and pass the name of a desired table.

```shell
SELECT * FROM pg_prewarm('public.records');
pg_prewarm
------------
     368023

 SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('public.records'));
 pg_size_pretty
 ----------------
 2875 MB
```

368023 pages have been read into the cache (or \~2875 MB).
:::

If the `shared buffers` size is less than pre-loaded data, only the
tailing end of the data is cached as the earlier data encounters a
forced ejection.

title: About PostgreSQL® disk usage
---

When you create your first Aiven for PostgreSQL® service, you may see
the disk usage gradually increasing even though you are not yet
inserting or updating much data.

![Disk space usage graph showing % growing over an hour](/images/content/products/postgresql/initial-disk-usage.png)

This is completely normal within the first 24 hours of operation for
Aiven for PostgreSQL services because of our WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)
archiving settings.

To prevent loss of data due to node failure on Hobbyist and Startup
plans, we set the `archive_timeout` configuration to write WAL segments
to disk at regular intervals. The WAL segments are then backed up to
cloud storage. Even if your service is idle, each WAL segment occupies
the same amount of space on disk, which is why the disk usage grows
steadily over time.

After the first 24 hours of service, the system begins archiving old WAL
segments and deleting them from disk to free up space. From this point
onward, new WAL segments no longer have such a high impact on disk usage
as the service reaches a steady state for low-traffic services.

You can read more about WAL archiving [in the PostgreSQL
manual](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-WAL-ARCHIVING).

## High disk usage discrepancy

There can be instances when you notice your disk space usage increasing
contrary to the amount of data is being written to your database. This
could be caused due to an inactive replication slot present in your
database.

You can check the list of replication slot subscriptions created on your
service using the following command:

```shell
SELECT * FROM aiven_extras.pg_list_all_subscriptions();
```

Inactive replication slots can cause indefinite increase in WAL log
size.

To resolve the issue, you can perform one of the following options:

-   Have a client connect to the replication slot so that the WAL files
    would be rotated and purged
-   Manually remove the unused replication slots (see our \"Remove
    unused replication setup\" under
    [Setup logical replication slots](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/setup-logical-replication) documentation)

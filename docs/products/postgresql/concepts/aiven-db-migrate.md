title: About aiven-db-migrate
---

The `aiven-db-migrate` tool is the recommended approach for migrating your PostgreSQL® to Aiven.
It supports both logical replication and also
using a dump and restore process. Find out more about the tool [on
GitHub](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-db-migrate).

Logical replication is the default method and once successfully set up,
this keeps the two databases synchronized until the replication is
interrupted. If the preconditions for logical replication are not met
for a database, the migration falls back to using `pg_dump`.

Regardless of the migration method used, the migration tool first
performs a schema dump and migration to ensure schema compatibility.

:::note
Logical replication also works when migrating from AWS RDS PostgreSQL®
10+ and [Google CloudSQL
PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/release-notes#August_30_2021).

## Migration requirements {#aiven-db-migrate-migration-requirements}

The following are the two basic requirements for a migration:

1.  The source server is publicly available or there is a virtual
    private cloud (VPC) peering connection between the private networks
2.  A user account with access to the destination cluster from an
    external IP, as configured in `pg_hba.conf` on the source cluster is
    present.

Additionally to perform a **logical replication**, the following need to
be valid:

1.  PostgreSQL® version 10 or newer

2.  Credentials with superuser access to the source cluster or the
    `aiven-extras` extension installed (see also: [Aiven Extras on
    GitHub](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras))

    :::note
    The `aiven_extras` extension allows you to perform
    publish/subscribe-style logical replication without a superuser
    account, and it is preinstalled on Aiven for PostgreSQL servers.
    :::

    -   An available replication slot on the destination cluster for
        each database migrated from the source cluster.
    -   `wal_level` setting on the source cluster to `logical`.

## Migration pre-checks

The `aiven-db-migrate` migration tool checks the following requirements
before it starts the actual migration:

1.  A connection can be established to both source and target servers
2.  The source and target server are not the same
3.  A connection can be established to all source databases, ignoring
    `template0`, `template1`, and admin databases
4.  There is enough disk space on the target for 130% of the total size
    of the source databases (ignoring `template0`, `template1`, and
    admin databases)
5.  There are at least as many free logical replication slots as there
    are databases to migrate
6.  A connection can be established to any target database that already
    exists on both source and target servers
7.  The target version is the same as or newer than the source version
8.  All languages installed in the source are available in the target
9.  All extensions in the source are installed or available in the
    target
10. Source extensions not installed in the target can be installed:
    -   by connecting as a superuser
    -   without requiring superuser access
    -   by inclusion in the allowed extensions list
    -   by being a trusted extension (for PostgreSQL® 13 and newer)
11. In addition, for using the logical replication method:
    -   The source version is PostgreSQL 10 or newer
    -   The source `wal_level` is set to `logical`
    -   The user connecting to the source has superuser access or the
        `aiven_extra` extension is or can be installed on each database

title: About TimescaleDB
---

[TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) is an open-source database designed to make your existing relational database scalable for time series data.
TimescaleDB is available as a PostgreSQLÂ® extension on Aiven.

A time series indexes a series of data points in chronological order,
usually as a sequence over regular intervals. Examples of a time series
include:

-   the temperature of a home during a day
-   the position of a satellite during a day

The data in these examples consists of a measured value (temperature or
position) corresponding to the time at which the reading of the value
took place.

## Enable TimescaleDB on Aiven for PostgreSQL

TimescaleDB is available as an extension; you can enable it by running:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb CASCADE;
```

After enabling the extension, you can create TimescaleDB hypertables and
make use of its features for working with time-series data. For further
information, have a look at the [Getting
Started](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/hypertables/create/)
guide from Timescale.

More information about
[how to install and manage extensions](/docs/products/postgresql/howto/manage-extensions) is also available.

## TSL-licensed features

The majority of TimescaleDB functionality is open source, however since
TimescaleDB 1.2.0 some features have been restricted to the Timescale
License, which explicitly prohibits them from being made available in
any database-as-a-service offering. Therefore some features, such as
`time_bucket_gapfill`, are not available on the Aiven hosted TimescaleDB
service.

When you try using these features, you will see an error similar to the
following:

`ERROR 0A000 (feature_not_supported) function "<function>" is not supported under the current license "ApacheOnly"`

Since Aiven only offers open source licensed platforms, these features
cannot be made available.

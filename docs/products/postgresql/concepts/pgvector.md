In machine learning (ML) models, all data items in a particular data set are mapped into one unified n-dimensional vector space, no matter how big the input data set is.

This optimized way of data representation
allows for high performance of AI algorithms. Mapping regular data into
a vector space requires so called data vectorizing, which is
transforming data items into vectors (data structures with at least two
components: magnitude and direction). On the vectorized data, you can
perform AI-powered operations using different instruments, one of them
being pgvector.

Discover the pgvector extension to Aiven for PostgreSQL速 and learn how
it works. Check why you might need it and what benefits you get using
it.

## About pgvector

pgvector is an open-source vector extension for similarity search. It's
available as an extension to your Aiven for PostgreSQL速 services.
pgvector introduces capabilities to store and search over data of the
vector type (ML-generated embeddings). Applying a specific index type
for querying a table, the extension enables you to search for vector's
exact nearest or approximate nearest neighbors (data items).

### Vector embeddings

In machine learning, real-world objects and concepts (text, images,
video, or audio) are represented as a set of continuous numbers residing
in a high-dimensional vector space. These numerical representations are
called vector embeddings, and the process of transformation into
numerical representations is called vector embedding. Vector embedding
allows ML algorithms to identify semantic and syntactic relationships
between data, find patterns, and make predictions. Vector
representations have different applications, for example, information
retrieval, image classification, sentiment analysis, natural language
processing, or similarity search.

### Vector similarity

Since on vector embeddings you can use AI tools for capturing
relationships between objects (vector representations), you are also
able to identify similarities between them in a computable and
scalable manner.

A vector usually represents a data point, and components of the vector
correspond to attributes of the data point. In most cases, vector
similarity calculations use distance metrics, for example, by measuring
the straight-line distance between two vectors or the cosine of the
angle between two vectors. The greater the resulting value of the
similarity calculation is, the more similar the vectors are, with 0 as
the minimum value and 1 as the maximum value.

## How pgvector works

-   Enabling pgvector: You enable the extension on your database.
-   Vectorizing data: You generate embeddings for your data, for
    example, for a products catalog using tools such as the [OpenAI
    API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create)
    client.
-   Storing embeddings: You store the embeddings in Aiven for PostgreSQL
    using the pgvector extension.
-   Querying embeddings: You use the embeddings for the vector
    similarity search on the products catalog.
-   Adding indices: By default, pgvector executes the *exact* nearest
    neighbor search, which gives the perfect recall. If you add an index
    to use the *approximate* nearest neighbor search, you can speed up
    your search, trading off some recall for performance.

## Why use pgvector

With the pgvector extension, you can perform the vector similarity
search and use embedding techniques directly in Aiven for PostgreSQL.
pgvector allows for efficient handling of high-dimensional vector data
within the Aiven for PostgreSQL database for tasks such as similarity
search, model training, data augmentation, or machine learning.

pgvector helps you optimize and personalize the similarity search
experience by improving searching speed and accuracy (also by adding
indices).

## Typical use cases

There are multiple industry applications for similarity searches over
vector embeddings:

-   e-commerce
-   recommendation systems
-   fraud detection

:::note[Examples]
-   AI-powered tools can find similarities between products or
    transactions, which can be used to produce product recommendations
    or detect potential scams or frauds.
-   Sentiment analysis: words represented with similar vector embeddings
    have similar sentiment scores.

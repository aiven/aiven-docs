title: Estimate maximum number of connection
---

The number of simultaneous connections in Aiven for RedisÂ®\* depends on
the total available memory on the server.

You can use the following to estimate:

``` 
{max\_number\_of\_connections} = 4\times m
```

where `m` represents the memory in megabytes. With at least 10,000
connections available, even on the smallest servers. For example, on a
server with 4GB memory (4,096 MB), the simultaneous connections are:

``` 
4\times 4096 = 16384 {\ connections}
```

:::note
Make sure to convert the memory figure `m` to megabytes.
:::

This number is estimated by the exact available memory so it varies
between different plans and cloud providers, to see the exact maximum
connections allowed, use \*
[redis-cli](/docs/products/redis/howto/connect-redis-cli) and `info` command as the following:

``` 
echo "info" | redis-cli -u REDIS_URI | grep maxclients
```

title: Troubleshoot Redis®* connection issues
---

Discover troubleshooting techniques for your Redis®\* service and check
out how to resolve common connection issues.

## Important notes

By default
[Aiven for Redis® uses SSL connections](/docs/products/redis/howto/manage-ssl-connectivity) and these connections are closed automatically after 12
hours. This is not a parameter that can be changed. Aiven also sets the
`redis_timeout` advanced parameter to 300 seconds by default.

## Some Redis®\* connections are closed intermittently

When experiencing connection issues with your Redis®\* service, here are
some common things to check: - Some Redis®\* clients do not support SSL
connections. It is recommended to check the documentation for the
Redis®\* client being used to ensure SSL connections are supported. - If
you are noticing older connections terminating, you should check to see
what the value is configured for the
[redis_timeout advanced parameter](/docs/products/redis/reference/advanced-params). This parameter controls the timeout value for idle
connections. Once the timeout is reached, the connection is terminated.

## Methods for troubleshooting connections

A great way to troubleshoot connection issues is to arrange for a packet
capture to take place. This can be achieved with tools like
[Tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) and
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). This allows you to see if
connections are making it outside your network to the Aiven for Redis®\*
instance.

Another tool you can use to help diagnose connection issues is the
Socket Statistics CLI tool which dumps socket statistics.

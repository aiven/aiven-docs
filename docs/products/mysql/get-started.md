Start using Aiven for MySQL® by creating and configuring a service.

## Create a service

[Create an Aiven for PostgreSQL® service](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service) in the
[Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io).

The new service appears on the **Services** page and its status
indicator shows **Rebuilding**. It usually takes a couple of minutes before the status
changes to **Running**.

## Configure a service

1.  Select the new service from the list of services on the **Services** page.

    This opens the **Overview** page of your service and shows its current status and
    connection parameters.

1.  On the **Overview** page, select **Service settings** from the
    sidebar to access the **Advanced configuration** section and make
    changes to the service configuration, even while the service is
    being built.

    Check the available configuration options in
    [Advanced parameters for Aiven for MySQL](/docs/products/mysql/reference/advanced-params).

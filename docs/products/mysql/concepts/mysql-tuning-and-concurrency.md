title: MySQL tuning for concurrency
---

**Determining how much memory is available for queries, and tuning
concurrency accordingly, requires calculation of service memory, query
analysis, and monitoring.**

Global buffers, thread buffers, and some uncontrolled memory allocations
(`TRIGGERS`, `PROCEDURES` and `FUNCTIONS`), all contribute to the memory
MySQL will require for a given workload.

There are several key calculations which are fundamental to tuning:

-   Service memory
-   Global buffers
-   Thread buffers
-   Concurrency

:::important
Query output is for reference only.

Queries should be run per service for accuracy and re-evaluated
periodically for change.
:::

## Service memory

The
[service memory](/docs/platform/concepts/service-memory-limits) can be calculated as:

where the overhead is currently .

## Global buffers

**MySQL pre-allocates global buffers to improve performance of database
operations.**

An explanation of these various buffers (or code areas) can be found in
the MySQL documentation: [How MySQL Uses
Memory](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/memory-use.html).

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(event_name,'/',2) AS code_area,
   format_bytes(SUM(current_alloc)) AS current_alloc
FROM sys.x$memory_global_by_current_bytes
GROUP BY SUBSTRING_INDEX(event_name,'/',2)
ORDER BY SUM(current_alloc) DESC;

+---------------------------+---------------+
| code_area                 | current_alloc |
+---------------------------+---------------+
| memory/innodb             | 1.37 GiB      |
| memory/performance_schema | 213.22 MiB    |
| memory/sql                | 18.73 MiB     |
| memory/mysys              | 8.82 MiB      |
| memory/temptable          | 1.00 MiB      |
| memory/mysqld_openssl     | 459.71 KiB    |
| memory/mysqlx             | 3.25 KiB      |
| memory/myisam             |  728 bytes    |
| memory/csv                |  120 bytes    |
| memory/vio                |   80 bytes    |
+---------------------------+---------------+
```

## Thread buffers

**Thread buffers are memory allocated per thread (or connection) to the
database.**

Queries may use part or all of the allocation.

```sql
SELECT ( @@read_buffer_size
+ @@read_rnd_buffer_size
+ @@sort_buffer_size
+ @@join_buffer_size
+ @@binlog_cache_size
+ @@thread_stack
+ @@tmp_table_size
+ 2*@@net_buffer_length
) / (1024 * 1024) AS MEMORY_PER_CON_MB;

+-------------------+
| MEMORY_PER_CON_MB |
+-------------------+
|           17.9375 |
+-------------------+
```

:::important
The actual amount of memory a query could use is technically unbounded.

Uncontrolled memory allocations and temporary table usage can adversely
affect memory allocation. The data dictionary size is based on the
number of tables, fields and indexes within the database.
:::

## Concurrency

Aiven configures a default value for the `max_connections` parameter for
all MySQL services.

The [max_connections](max-number-of-connections) parameter is based off the service
[usable memory](/docs/platform/concepts/service-memory-limits).

```sql
select @@max_connections;
+-------------------+
| @@max_connections |
+-------------------+
|               226 |
+-------------------+
```

:::important
This parameter should be used as a guideline only.

By default, `max_connections` is configured for *optimistic* concurrency
using all available memory.

In many instances, if the `max connections` are fully utilized, resource
overcommitment and
[Out of memory conditions](/docs/platform/concepts/out-of-memory-conditions) will occur.
:::

At \~18 MB per connection, a 4 GiB service has a potential memory usage
of 4068 MB (18 \* 226). This is less than the service RAM, but exceeds
the
[service memory limit](/docs/platform/concepts/service-memory-limits).

**For performance and stability, the following calculation is
recommended:**

$max\_concurrency =$

This value may be pessimistic for a workload that does not require the
full thread buffer, but is an advisable starting point for concurrency
testing and monitoring. Concurrency can be incremented, if service
memory permits.

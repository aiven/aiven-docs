## MySQL replication overview {#myslq-replication-overview}

MySQL replication is always based on replicating logical changes. This
means that the replication protocol may contain an actual statement that
the target server should apply or it may have an entry saying **update
row with these old attributes to have these new attributes**. These are
called statement and row formats.

The statement format is more compact but can\'t represent all changes
because some statements would yield different results if executed as is
on different servers. The row format statement can represent all
changes, and it allows using tools like Debezium since the binary log
contains full details of all changes in itself. For these reasons, Aiven
uses row format by default. Read more about the comparison between MySQL
statement based and row based replication on the [Advantages and
Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based
Replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-sbr-rbr.html)
article.

The row based replication works very well as long as the tables being
replicated have a primary key. MySQL primary key look ups are very fast
and the target server can find the rows to update and delete very
quickly. However, when the table being replicated is lacking a primary
key, the target server needs to make a sequential table scan for each
individual update or delete statement and the replication can become
extremely slow if the table is large.

``` bash
DELETE FROM nopk WHERE modified_time > '2022-01-13'
```

If a statement like the above matched 500 rows and the table had a
million rows altogether, the row based replication format would contain
500 individual delete operations and the target server needed to do
sequential scan over the one million rows for each of the individual
deletions, which could take tens of minutes. If the table had a primary
key, the same statement would likely be replicated in under a second.

## Replication use in Aiven for MySQL

The considerations presented on the
[Replication overview](/docs/products/mysql/concepts/mysql-replication#myslq-replication-overview) section are not only valid for services that actually have
standby nodes or read-only replicas. Whenever the Aiven management
platform needs to create a new node for a service, the node is first
initialized from backup to most recent backed up state. This includes
applying the full replication stream that has been created after the
most recent full base backup. Once the latest backed up state has been
restored the node will connect to the current master, if available, and
replicate latest state from that, which is also affected by possible
replication slowness.

When new nodes are created, it needs to perform replication and having
large tables without primary keys may make operations such as replacing
failed nodes, upgrading service plan, migrating service to a different
cloud provider or region, starting up new read-only replica service,
forking a service, and some others to take extremely long time or
depending on the situation practically not complete at all without
manual operator intervention (for example, new read-only replica might never be
able to catch up with existing master because replication is too slow).

To work around these issues Aiven operations people may need to resort
to operations such as temporarily making `master` read only or promoting
a replacement server before it has fully applied the replication stream,
resulting in data loss.

To make the service operate correctly and avoid such drastic measures
you should ensure the primary keys exist for any tables that are not
trivially small. You can check the article how to
[create missing primary keys](/docs/products/mysql/howto/create-missing-primary-keys) to ensure primary keys exists in your Aiven for MySQL
service.

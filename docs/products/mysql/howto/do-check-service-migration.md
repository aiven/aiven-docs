title: Perform pre-migration check
---

In this article, we show how to find potential errors before starting
your database migration process. This can be done by using either the
[Aiven CLI](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client) or [Aiven REST
API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#section/Introduction).

When migrating a database to Aiven, you may find errors such as:

```shell
{
    "migration": {
        "error": "Migration process failed",
        "method": "",
        "seconds_behind_master": null,
        "source_active": true,
        "status": "done"
    },
    "migration_detail": []
}
-----Response End-----
STATUS METHOD ERROR
====== ====== ========================
done Migration process failed
```

To avoid these types of failures during the migration process we
recommend you run some checks in advance. In this article, we will show
how you can run those checks for your MySQL migration process.

## Aiven CLI

**Step 1: create a task to perform the migration check.**

You can create the task of migration, for example, from a MySQL DB to an
Aiven service (`project`: `MY_PROJECT_NAME`, `service`: `mysql`):

```shell
avn service task-create --project PROJECT_NAME --operation migration_check --source-service-uri mysql://user:password@host:port/databasename --project MY_PROJECT_NAME mysql
```

You can see the information about the task including the ID.

```shell
TASK_TYPE              SUCCESS  TASK_ID
=====================  =======  ====================================
mysql_migration_check  null     e2df7736-66c5-4696-b6c9-d33a0fc4cbed
```

:::tip
You can find more options available via the -h menu, for example, to
ignore certain databases for the check. Please note that filter
databases are supported by MySQL only at the moment.
:::

**Step 2: retrieve your task's status.**

You can check the status of your task by running:

```
avn service task-get --project PROJECT_NAME --task-id e2df7736-66c5-4696-b6c9-d33a0fc4cbed --project MY_PROJECT_NAME mysql
```

You can find whether the operation succeeds and more relevant
information about the migration.

```shell
TASK_TYPE              SUCCESS  TASK_ID                               RESULT
=====================  =======  ====================================  ====================================================================================
mysql_migration_check  true     e2df7736-66c5-4696-b6c9-d33a0fc4cbed  All pre-checks passed successfully, preferred migration method will be [Replication]
```

## Aiven REST API

The same checks can be performed via the REST API. More details can be

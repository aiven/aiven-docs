title: Create new tables without primary keys
---

If your Aiven for MySQLÂ® service was created after 2020-06-03, by
default it does not allow creating new tables without primary keys. You
can check this by taking the following steps:

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

2.  On the **Services** page, select your Aiven for MySQL service that
    you want to check.

3.  On your service's page, select **Service settings** from the
    sidebar.

4.  On the **Service settings** page of your service, scroll down to the
    **Advanced configuration** section.

5.  Check the **Advanced configuration** section for the
    `mysql.sql_require_primary_key` parameter and its status.

    If `mysql.sql_require_primary_key` is enabled, your Aiven for MySQL
    does not allow you to create new tables without primary keys.
    Attempts to create tables without primary keys will result in the
    following error message:

    ```
    Unable to create or change a table without a primary key, when the system variable 'sql_require_primary_key' is set. Add a primary key to the table or unset this variable to avoid this message. Note that tables without a primary key can cause performance problems in row-based replication, so please consult your DBA before changing this setting.
    ```

    If creating tables without primary keys is prevented and the table
    that you're trying to create is known to be small, you may override
    this setting and create the table anyway.

[Replication overview](/docs/products/mysql/concepts/mysql-replication#myslq-replication-overview) article.

You have two options to create the tables:

-   Setting `mysql.sql_require_primary_key` to `0` for the current
    session with the following command:

    ```shell
    SET SESSION sql_require_primary_key = 0; and then execute the CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement again in the same session.
    ```

-   Disabling `mysql.sql_require_primary_key` parameter. To disable the
    `mysql.sql_require_primary_key` parameter, take the following steps:

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

2.  On the **Services** page, select your Aiven for MySQL service that
    you want to check.

3.  On your service's page, select **Service settings** from the
    sidebar.

4.  On the **Service settings** page of your service, scroll down to the
    **Advanced configuration** section and select **Configure**.

5.  In the **Advanced configuration** window, find
    `mysql.sql_require_primary_key` and disable it by using the toggle
    switch. Select **Save configuration**.

    :::warning
    It is only recommended to use this approach when the table is
    created by an external application and using the session variable is
    not an option. To prevent more problematic tables from being
    unexpectedly created in the future you should enable the setting
    again once you finished creating the tables without primary keys.

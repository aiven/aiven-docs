title: Create Aiven for MySQL® remote replicas
---

Learn how to create an Aiven for MySQL® remote replica to provide a
read-only instance of your managed MySQL service in another
geographically-autonomous region.

## About remote replicas

Aiven for MySQL read-only replicas provide a great way to reduce the
load on the primary server by enabling read-only queries to be performed
against the replica. It is also a good way to optimise query response
times across different geographical locations since, with Aiven, the
replica can be placed in different regions or even different cloud
providers.

Using read-only replicas works as an extra measure to protect your data
from the unlikely event that a whole region would go down. It can also
improve performance if a read-only replica is placed closer to your
end-users that read from the database.

## Create a remote replica

Take the following steps to provision a remote replica:

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) using your
    credentials.
2.  In the **Services** page, select an Aiven for MySQL service for
    which you wish to create a remote replica.
3.  In the **Overview** page of your service, go to section **Read-only
    replicas** and select **Create replica**.
4.  In the **Create a MySQL read replica** window, give your service a
    name, select the cloud provider and region, and choose a suitable
    Aiven for MySQL plan. Select **Create** to add the defined replica.

You can see the read-only replica being created and listed next to other
Aiven service in the **Services** page in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

title: Detect and terminate long-running queries
---

Aiven does not terminate any customer queries even if they run
indefinitely, but long-running queries can cause issues by locking
resources and therefore preventing database maintenance tasks such as
backups.

To identify and terminate such long-running queries, you can do it from
either:

-   [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io)
-   [MySQL shell](/docs/products/mysql/howto/connect-from-cli) (`mysql`)

## Terminate long running queries from the Aiven Console

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).
2.  From the **Services** page, select your Aiven for MySQLÂ® service.
3.  In your service's page, select **Current queries** from the
    sidebar.
4.  In the **Current queries** page, you can check the query duration
    and select **Terminate** to stop any long-running queries.

## Detect and terminate long running queries via CLI

You can
[login to your service](/docs/products/mysql/howto/connect-from-cli) using `mysqlsh` or `mysql`. Once connected, you can call the
following command on the `mysql` shell to view all running queries:

```shell
SHOW PROCESSLIST WHERE command = 'Query' AND info NOT LIKE '%PROCESSLIST%';
```

You can learn more about the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` command from the
[official
documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-processlist.html).

You can terminate a query manually using:

```shell
KILL QUERY pid
```

where the `pid` is the process ID output by the `SHOW PROCESSLIST`
command above.

You can learn more about the `KILL QUERY` command from the [MySQL KILL
documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/kill.html).

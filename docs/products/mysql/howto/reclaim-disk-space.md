title: Reclaim disk space
---

You can configure InnoDB to release disk space back to the operating system by running the `OPTIMIZE TABLE` command.

:::note
[Under certain
conditions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimize-table.html#optimize-table-innodb-details)
(for example, including the presence of a `FULLTEXT` index), command
`OPTIMIZE TABLE`
[copies](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html#alter-table-performance)
the data to a new table containing just the current data, and drops
and renames the new table to match the old one. During this process,
data modification is blocked. This requires enough free space to store
two copies of the current data at once.
:::

To ensure that the space is also reclaimed on standby nodes, run the
command as below without any additional modifiers like
`NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG` or `LOCAL`:

```
``OPTIMIZE TABLE defaultdb.mytable;``
```

If you do not have enough free space to run the `OPTIMIZE TABLE`
command, you can:

-   Start by **optimizing smaller tables** to free up space. Next, you
    can proceed with optimizing on larger tables.
-   **Temporarily upgrade to a larger service plan** to get access to
    more disk space. You can downgrade your plan again afterward. Read
    more on how to
    [upgrade your plan](/docs/platform/howto/scale-services) for that.

:::note
When you perform a temporary upgrade, it may require waiting for a
smaller backup to take place before downgrading the plan again.

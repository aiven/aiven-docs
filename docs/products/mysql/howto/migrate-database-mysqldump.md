title: Backup and restore Aiven for MySQL® data using mysqldump
---

Backing up your Aiven for MySQ® data to another storage service is a
good way to ensure access to your data in case a failure occurs. This
article shows you how to copy your Aiven for MySQL data to a file, back
it up to another Aiven for MySQL database, and restore it using the
`mysqldump`
[tool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html).

## Prerequisites

-   The `mysqldump`
    [tool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html)
    installed. Check out the [official
    MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html)
    documentation on how to install it.
-   A source MySQL database to copy your data from. We will refer to it
    as `source-db`.
-   A target MySQL database to dump your `source-db` data to. We will
    refer to it as `target-db`.

:::tip
For the restore process, we recommend you pick a plan size that is large
enough to store your data, so you can limit the downtime if you're
performing a migration.
:::

The below example uses Aiven for MySQL databases for both the
`source-db` and `target-db`. You can create the databases by following
the instruction in
[Create additional Aiven for MySQL® databases](/docs/products/mysql/howto/create-database).

## Back up the data

### Variables

To backup the `source-db` data to a file called `mydb_backup.sql` you
need to collect some information about your Aiven for MySQL `source-db`
database. Go to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) > your Aiven
for MySQL `source-db` service > **Overview** > the **Connection
information** section and find the following information:

 | Variable             | Description                                 |
 | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
 | `SOURCE_DB_HOST`     | **Host** name for the connection            |
 | `SOURCE_DB_USER`     | **User** name for the connection            |
 | `SOURCE_DB_PORT`     | Connection **Port** number                  |
 | `SOURCE_DB_PASSWORD` | Connection **Password**                     |
 | `DEFAULTDB`          | Database that contains the `source-db` data |

### Commands

Use the following command to back up your Aiven for MySQL data to a file
named `mydb_backup.sql`:

```shell
mysqldump \
-p DEFAULTDB -P SOURCE_DB_PORT \
-h SOURCE_DB_HOST --single-transaction \
-u SOURCE_DB_USER --set-gtid-purged=OFF \
--password > mydb_backup.sql
```

With this command, the password will be requested at the prompt; paste
`SOURCE_DB_PASSWORD` to the terminal, then a file named
`mydb_backup.sql` will be created with your backup data. Note that
having the prompt request for the password is more secure than including
the password straight away in the command.

The `--single-transaction`
[flag](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_single-transaction)
starts a transaction in isolation mode `REPEATABLE READ` before running.
This allows `mysqldump` to read the database in its current state at the
time of the transaction, ensuring consistency of the data.

:::warning
If you are using [Global Transaction
Identifiers](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids-concepts.html)
(GTIDs) with InnoDB use the `--set-gtid-purged=OFF`
[option](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_set-gtid-purged).
The reason is that GTID's are not available with MyISAM.

## Restore the data

### Variables

To restore data saved in a file to an Aiven for MySQL database, you need
to include the connection information for the service in the `mysqldump`
command. Go to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) > your Aiven
for MySQL `target-db` service > **Overview** > the **Connection
information** section and find the following information:

  | Variable             | Description                                 |
  | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
  | `TARGET_DB_HOST`     | **Host** name for the connection            |
  | `TARGET_DB_USER`     | **User** name for the connection            |
  | `TARGET_DB_PORT`     | Connection **Port** number                  |
  | `TARGET_DB_PASSWORD` | Connection **Password**                     |
  | `DEFAULTDB`          | Database that contains the `target-db` data |

### Commands

Run the following command to load your saved data into your Aiven for
MySQL database:

```shell
mysqldump \
-p DEFAULTDB -P TARGET_DB_PORT \
-h TARGET_DB_HOST \
-u TARGET_DB_USER \
--password < mydb_backup.sql
```

The password will be requested at the prompt. You can paste
`TARGET_DB_PASSWORD` into the terminal. Your data should be stored in
your Aiven for MySQL `target-db`. You can check out `mysqlcheck`
[command](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqlcheck.html) to
perform further analysis of your current MySQL data.

title: Create missing primary keys
---

Primary keys are important
[for MySQL replication process](/docs/products/mysql/concepts/mysql-replication#myslq-replication-overview). In this article, you can find strategies to create missing
primary keys in your Aiven for MySQLÂ® service.

## List tables without primary key

Once you are connected to the MySQL database, you can determine which
tables are missing primary keys by running the following commands:

```shell
SELECT
    tab.table_schema AS database_name,
    tab.table_name AS table_name,
    tab.table_rows AS table_rows
FROM information_schema.tables tab
LEFT JOIN information_schema.table_constraints tco
    ON (tab.table_schema = tco.table_schema
        AND tab.table_name = tco.table_name
        AND tco.constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY')
WHERE
    tab.table_schema NOT IN ('mysql', 'information_schema', 'performance_schema', 'sys')
    AND tco.constraint_type IS NULL
    AND tab.table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
```

To see the exact table definition for the problematic tables you can run
the following command:

```shell
SHOW CREATE TABLE database_name.table_name;
```

If your table already contains a column or set of columns that can be
used as primary key or composite key, then using such column(s) is
recommended.

In the next sections, find examples of tables definitions and the
guidance on how to create the missing primary keys.

## Example: add primary key

```shell
CREATE TABLE person (
social_security_number VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
first_name TEXT,
last_name TEXT
);
```

You can create the missing primary key by adding the primary key:

```shell
ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY (social_security_number);
```

You don't have to explicitly define it as UNIQUE, [as the primary key
is always unique in
MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/primary-key-optimization.html).

## Example: add a new separate id column

```shell
CREATE TABLE team_membership (
user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
team_id BIGINT NOT NULL
);
```

Add the primary key using the following query:

```shell
ALTER TABLE team_membership ADD PRIMARY KEY (user_id, team_id);
```

If none of the existing columns or a combination of the existing columns
cannot be used as the primary key, add a new separate id column. Check
how to deal with it in
[Example: alter table error](/docs/products/mysql/howto/create-missing-primary-keys#myslq-alter-table-error).

```shell
ALTER TABLE mytable ADD id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT;
```

## Example: alter table error `mysql.innodb_online_alter_log_max_size` {#myslq-alter-table-error}

When executing the `ALTER TABLE` statement for a large table, you may
encounter an error similar to the following:

```shell
Creating index 'PRIMARY' required more than 'mysql.innodb_online_alter_log_max_size' bytes of modification log. Please try again.
```

For the operation to succeed, you need to set a value that is high
enough. Depending on the table size, this could be a few gigabytes or
even more for very large tables. You can change
`mysql.innodb_online_alter_log_max_size` as follows: [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) > your Aiven for MySQL service's
page > the **Service settings** page of the service > the **Advanced
configuration** section > **Configure** > **Add configuration
options** > `mysql.innodb_online_alter_log_max_size` > set a value >
**Save configuration**.

title: Create additional Aiven for MySQL® databases
---

Once you've created your Aiven for MySQL® service, you can add
additional databases, whether for security purposes or to isolate your
data per application.

To create a new MySQL® database, take the following steps:

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

2.  In the **Services** page, select an Aiven for MySQL service for
    which you want to create a new database.

3.  In your service's page, select **Databases** from the sidebar.

4.  In the **Databases** view, select **Create database**.

5.  In the **Create a new database** window, enter a name for your
    database into the **Name** field and select **Add database**.

    The new database will be visible immediately.

You can also use the
[Aiven client](/docs/tools/cli/service/database#avn-service-database-create) or the
[MySQL client](/docs/products/mysql/howto/connect-from-cli) to create your database from the CLI.

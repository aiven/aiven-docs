## Custom plans

Aiven for Grafana plans are optimized for working well in the various
clouds supported by Aiven. The plans also enable migration between the
clouds. Should any available plans not be an ideal fit for your
workload, we\'re happy to tailor a custom plan for you to better suit
your needs.

## Billing

All Aiven services, including Aiven for Grafana, are billed based on
actual usage, which means you only pay for what you use: no up-front
fees and no termination charges.

The minimum hourly charge unit is one hour. Powering off or deleting a
service stops the accumulation of charges immediately. We calculate your
final bill based on your consumption over that period and deliver it as
a single invoice per project. For generating a consolidated invoice
across multiple projects, [manage billing groups in Aiven
Console](/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups).

### Billing on partial hours

Minutes of usage are rounded to the nearest hour. However, the one-hour
minimum charge unit still applies.

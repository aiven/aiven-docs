title: Dashboard preview for Aiven for Grafana®
---

Grafana's Dashboard Previews feature is a great way to get an overview
of all your dashboards. Instead of a list view of all your dashboards,
you can now see a graphical representation for each dashboard
configured.

The dashboard previews feature is an opt-in beta feature available in
Grafana 9.0+. This feature is disabled by default on the Aiven for
Grafana® service.

:::note
Dashboard previews are not available for Hobbyist and Startup-1 plans.

## Enable dashboard previews

Follow these steps to enable dashboard previews for your Aiven for
Grafana service:

1.  In the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), select your
    project and then choose your Aiven for Grafana® service.

2.  In the service page, select **Service settings** from the sidebar.

3.  On the **Service settings** page, scroll down to the **Advanced
    configuration** section, and click **Configure**.

4.  In the **Advanced configuration** dialog, click **Add configuration
    option**.

5.  Find and set `dashboad_previews_enabled` to **Enabled** position.

6.  Click the **Save configuration**. You will notice the status next to
    `dashboad_previews_enabled` change from `not synced` to `synced`.

7.  Using the **Service URI**, open the Grafana login page.

8.  Enter the username and password, and click **Log in**.

9.  Click **Dashboards** on the left side menu, and select the grid
    layout to view dashboard previews of all the dashboards. Dashboard
    previews are rendered as thumbnails and can be sorted
    alphabetically.

## Limitations

-   Dashboard previews are not available for Hobbyist and Startup-1
    plans.
-   Before downgrading your service plan to Hobbyist or Startup-1, where
    dashboard previews are unavailable, you need first to disable it on
    the current service.

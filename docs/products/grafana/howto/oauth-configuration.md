title: Grafana® OAuth configuration and security considerations
---

Grafana® version 9.5.5 introduced significant changes to the OAuth email lookup behavior to enhance security. However, some users may need to revert to the previous behavior as seen in Grafana 9.5.3.
This section
provides information on how to revert to the 9.5.3 behavior using the
`oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup` configuration option, its
implications, and the associated security threats.

## Security considerations

Before reverting to the previous behavior of Grafana version 9.5.3, it
is important to consider the security risks involved.

### Authentication bypass vulnerability

By enabling the `oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup` configuration
option, the system becomes susceptible to a critical authentication
bypass vulnerability using Azure AD OAuth. This vulnerability is
officially identified as CVE-2023-3128 and can potentially grant
attackers access to sensitive information or unauthorized actions. For
more information, refer to the following links:

-   [Grafana Labs Security Advisory:
    CVE-2023-3128](https://grafana.com/security/security-advisories/cve-2023-3128/)
-   [Alternative link for
    CVE-2023-3128](https://cve.report/CVE-2023-3128)

## Configuring OAuth email lookup

To revert to the OAuth email lookup behavior of Grafana version 9.5.3,
you can use the `oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup` configuration
option.

### Enable configuration

To enable this configuration, include the following line in your Grafana
configuration file:

```ini
[auth]
oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup = true
```

This will restore the behavior to that of Grafana version 9.5.3.
However, be aware of the potential security risks if you choose
to do so.

## Upgrade to Grafana 9.5.5

In Grafana 9.5.5, the insecure email lookup behavior has been removed to
mitigate the security threat. We recommend upgrading to this version to
ensure the security of your system.

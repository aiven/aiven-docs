title: Replace strings in Grafana® dashboards
---

Sometimes, it is useful to replace all occurrences of a string in
Grafana® metric expressions. This page describes how to do that using
the `aiven-string-replacer-for-grafana` tool, which is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-string-replacer-for-grafana).

The approach described will work with your own Grafana® cluster or with
an Aiven for Grafana® cluster

## Prerequisites

Building the tool requires a Go environment. Follow the [Go installation
instructions](https://go.dev/dl/).

To build the tool from its [source
repository](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-string-replacer-for-grafana),
run the following at the terminal prompt:

```bash
go install github.com/aiven/aiven-string-replacer-for-grafana
```

## Values you will need

 | Variable                | Description                                   |
 | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
 | `GRAFANA_API_KEY`       | The API key for accessing Grafana             |
 | `GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_URL` | The URL for the Grafana dashboard             |
 | `GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_UID` | The UID that identifies the Grafana dashboard |
 | `OLD_STRING`            | The old string, that you want to replace      |
 | `NEW_STRING`            | The new string, that you want to use instead  |

### Get the Grafana API key

The key needs the Grafana API key to be able to edit the Grafana
dashboards.

To get your API key (`GRAFANA_API_KEY`):

-   Go to your Grafana® UI. Select the **Configuration** icon and then
    select the **API keys** tab

-   If you already have an appropriate API key available, save a copy of
    it.

-   Otherwise, select **Add API key** and fill in the *Key name*, *Role*
    and *Time to live*. Click **Add** and then save the new API key.

    :::tip
    *Role* must be either *Editor* or *Admin*.
    :::

### To get the Grafana dashboard URL and UID

To get the dashboard URL and UID (`GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_URL` and
`GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_UID`):

-   Go to the dashboard on which you want to change metric expression
    strings.
-   Save the dashboard URL (`GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_URL`).
-   Select the **Dashboard settings** icon, then select **JSON Model**.
    Save the dashboard *UID* from the *JSON Model* page
    (`GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_UID`).

## Perform the replacement

Use a command like the following to perform the replacement, changing
the placeholder variable names to the values you collected above:

```bash
aiven-string-replacer-for-grafana \
    -apikey GRAFANA_API_KEY \
    -url GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_URL \
    -from OLD_STRING \
    -to NEW_STRING \
    -uid GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_UID
```

## Example: changing `elasticsearch_` to `opensearch_`

For instance, use the following command to change all metric expressions
that start with `elasticsearch_` to instead start with `opensearch_`:

```bash
aiven-string-replacer-for-grafana \
    -apikey GRAFANA_API_KEY \
    -url YOUR_DASHBOARD_URL \
    -from elasticsearch_ \
    -to opensearch_ \
    -uid YOUR_DASHBOARD_UID
```

The change will be visible in the *Query* panel:

-   Before running the command, metrics start with `elasticsearch_`:

-   After running the command, metrics start with `opensearch_`:

## Use the version history to revert

If necessary, the *Dashboard changelog* page can be used to revert a
change to a specific version.

-   Go to the dashboard that you modified.
-   Select the **Dashboard settings** icon, then select **Versions**.
-   This will show your Dashboard changelog, and you can use this to
    revert to an earlier version of the dashboard.

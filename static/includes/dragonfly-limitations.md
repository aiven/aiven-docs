## Migration limitations at General Availability (GA)

As Aiven for Dragonfly moves to General Availability (GA), the focus is on delivering
the most valuable features to you, guided by your feedback. During the initial phase of
GA, automatic migration of Users, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and service configurations
from Redis to Dragonflyare not included.

What this means:

- **Service configurations:** If youâ€™ve customized your Redis service with
  specific settings, you must manually apply these settings to Dragonfly. Automatic
  transfer of these custom configurations is not available during the initial phase of GA.

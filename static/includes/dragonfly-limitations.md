## Migration limitations for General Availability (GA)

As Aiven for Dragonfly moves to General Availability (GA), the focus is on delivering
valuable features on user feedback. During the initial GA phase, automatic migration of
users, access control lists (ACLs), and service configurations from Redis to Dragonfly
is not supported.

If you customized your Aiven for Caching or Aiven for Valkey service with specific
settings, manually apply these settings to Aiven for Dragonfly. Automatic transfer of
custom configurations isnâ€™t available during the initial GA phase.

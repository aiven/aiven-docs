**Breaking changes in Debezium 2.5**

Debezium version 2.5 introduces changes to the connector's configuration and behavior.
New setups [default to version 2.5](https://debezium.io/releases/2.5/release-notes),
while existing setups using version 1.9 remain on that version for stability.

If you are using version 1.9.7, you can upgrade to version 2.5.0 using
[multi-version support](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/manage-connector-versions)
without raising a support ticket. Ensure compatibility by testing version 2.5
configurations before upgrading.

For further assistance, contact [Aiven support](mailto:support@aiven.io).

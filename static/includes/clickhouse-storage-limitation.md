:::note[Total storage with a plan]

Total storage represents the maximum amount of data you can insert into a service, which
doesn't depend on the number of nodes.

The inserted data is replicated on all available nodes. How many times it's replicated
depends on the number of nodes and the number of shards:

```math
number_of_data_replication_times = number_of_nodes / number_of_shards
```

**Examples**

- Service plan with **one shard**

  The Startup-16 plan has 1150 GB of total storage per VM, same as with
  the Business-16 plan. Since the Business-16 plan offers three VMs, your total storage is
  3450 GB, but effectively it's still 1150 GB because thatâ€™s the maximum a single node can
  hold.

- Service plan with **two shards**

  The Premium-6x-16 plan has two shards and six servers, each server with
  1150 GB of storage. The data you insert is replicated three times.

To shift the backup schedule to a new time:

1. Open your service.
1. Click **Service settings** page.
1. In **Advanced configuration**, click **Configure**, and use the `backup_hour` and `backup_minute`.

   If a backup was recently made, it can take another backup cycle before the new backup
   time takes effect.

:::note
Datadog integration is not available for new Startup-2 plans in Aiven for Apache Kafka.
Existing customers using Startup-2 with Datadog integration can continue to create new
Startup-2 plans with Datadog integration and use their existing services without
upgrading to a higher plan.

Aiven recommends using a **Business-4 plan or higher** for Aiven for Apache Kafka
services with Datadog integration to avoid resource pressure on Startup-2 plans.

If you are an existing customer and cannot create a Startup-2 plan with Datadog
integration in a new project, contact [Aiven Support](mailto:support@aiven.io).

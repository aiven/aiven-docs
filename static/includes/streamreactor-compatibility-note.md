**Version compatibility**

Stream Reactor version 9.0.2 includes class and package name changes introduced in
versionâ€¯6.0.0 by Lenses. These changes standardize connector class names and converter
package names.

Version 9.x is not compatible with version 4.2.0. To continue using version 4.2.0,
[set the connector version](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/manage-connector-versions#set-version)
before upgrading.

If you are upgrading from version 4.2.0, you must recreate the connector using the
updated class name. For example:

```json
"connector.class": "io.lenses.streamreactor.connect.<connector_path>.<ConnectorClassName>"
```

For details about the changes, see the
[Stream Reactor release notes](https://docs.lenses.io/stream-reactor/docs/releases/).
